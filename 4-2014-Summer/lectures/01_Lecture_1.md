* A main landing page with the logo and description of the league.
* A schedule of games for the current season for the three participating teams.
* A link to a PDF registration form that players can download and fax in.
* Basic contact information for the league organizers.

**Phase 2: Client and server side capabilities**

* A main landing page with the league logo and description of the league.
* A player interface where users can a) register, b) pay dues, c) see what upcoming games they have, etc.
* An admin interface where the league owners can administer a) teams, b) league standings, c) who has paid their dues, etc.

## Suggested strategy
1. Pre-lecture: Skim the notes.
2. Lecture: Take notes; don't try to follow along with the examples on your laptop. 
4. Post-lecture: Go through the notes again and complete any tasks which were covered.

* Document everything you do.
* Make notes about what you don't understand&mdash; go back and answer those questions as you move along.
