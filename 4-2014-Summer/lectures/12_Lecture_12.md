Regretfully, today's lecture (Thursday July 31st) is cancelled.

In lieu of lecture, here's how you should spend the class time:

1. Work on P4

2. Read the lecture notes from what was on the schedule to be covered today:

	+ [Testing](https://github.com/susanBuck/notes/blob/master/05_Laravel/17_Testing.md)
	+ [Laravel & JavaScript](https://github.com/susanBuck/notes/blob/master/05_Laravel/18_JavaScript.md)

I've made the notes more detailed than usual to accommodate not being able to cover this material in a lecture.

## Quiz 11

There is a Quiz 11 but because lecture is cancelled it consists of 1 very simple question. Everyone should get 100%. 

The quiz is available now, so take it before you forget.



## For next week...

As discussed, our next class (Tuesday August 5th) will be an open workshop. Bring your laptops/projects. Myself and the TAs, as well as your fellow classmates, will be on hand to help answer questions as you work on wrapping up your P4s.

I'll bring some extra power strips to accommodate for the lack of plugs in the lecture hall, but if you have one you can bring along that'd be great.
