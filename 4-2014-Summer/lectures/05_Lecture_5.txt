## Setup
This lecture will walk through the process of creating the foobooks app. 
To prepare for this:

+ Remove foobooks app from local
+ Make sure there's an available app in OpenShift
+ Make sure there's no foobooks app on github.com




## Routing explained

index.php: 

	<h1>Welcome to foobooks</h1>

	Choose a category:
	<a href='get_books.php?category=mystery'>Mystery</a>
	<a href='get_books.php?category=science'>Science</a>

get_books.php:

	Here are all the books under the category: <?php echo $_GET['category']; ?>

http://localhost/index.php?category=mystery
becomes
http://localhost/get_books.php?category=mystery

The URL is no longer about particular files. Instead it's a set of instructions.
