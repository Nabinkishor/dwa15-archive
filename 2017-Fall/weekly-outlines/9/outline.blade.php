## Project 3 Help
+ There are no lecture videos or new material this week as you should be focussing on finalizing Project 3.
+ In addition to regular office hours this week I'll be online in the [chat](/chat) Wed Oct 25 8-10pm for questions/troubleshooting help.
+ Reminder that I'm travelling next week and won't be holding office hours so my ability to help you troubleshoot then will be limited. Because of this, it's imperative that you utilize this &ldquo;workshop&rdquo; week to complete your project&mdash; do not put it off just because we don't have lecture videos.
+ Despite the atypical nature of this week, there is still a progress log to be completed (linked above) and submitted per the usual timeline. This week's progress log is particularly important because it includes P3 finalization questions.
