[PHP Cont'd](https://github.com/susanBuck/dwa15-fall2017/tree/master/02_PHP):
    + [Classes](https://github.com/susanBuck/dwa15-fall2017/blob/master/02_PHP/12_Classes.md)
    + [Validation](https://github.com/susanBuck/dwa15-fall2017/blob/master/02_PHP/13_Validation.md)


After watching this week's lecture videos, be sure to read through the Foobooks0 final code ([`index.php`](https://github.com/susanBuck/foobooks0/blob/master/index.php) and [`getAllBooks.php`](https://github.com/susanBuck/foobooks0/blob/master/getAllBooks.php))&mdash; I wrapped up the validation, added more comments, and did a little bit of refactoring. The concepts are all the same, you'll just see things organized slightly different from the end product in the video.

Also, a reminder that you can interact with the final application here: <http://foobooks0.dwa15.me>.
