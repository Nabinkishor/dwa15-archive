+ There are no lecture videos or new material this week as you should be focussing on finalizing Project 4.
+ In addition to regular [office hours](/office-hours), I'll be online in the [course chat](/chat) Wed Dec 6 8-10pm Eastern for questions/troubleshooting help.
+ Your final progress log of the semester is linked above. This log must be submitted __before Wed Dec 13 @ 11:59pm Eastern__. Late work can not be accepted as it's the end of the semester.
+ This final progress log contains more content than usual (given it's applicable to P4 and the final log of the semester). Because of this, you should carefully read through the log before completing it to make sure you're clear on everything you need to do.
+ If interested, [I posted some bonus content](https://github.com/susanBuck/dwa15-fall2017/issues/198) regarding streamlining controllers and testing.
