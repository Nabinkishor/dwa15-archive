# Week 4 progress log - correction to question #10

Hi everyone,

Small correction on the wording to Question 10 on [Week 4's progress log template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PVbwKxop-G_5jcWNl1-Y1nspFz7Zjn4Zp_v9p5y5bvU/edit).

The original wording said this:

>> *Define a function called removeVowels, that accepts a String and returns that same string altered so that all vowels are removed.*

This wording did not match the provided example, which shows the argument as an __Array__, not a String:

```
removeVowels(['a', 'p', 'p', 'l', 'e'])
```

The wording has been corrected to this:

>> *Define a function called removeVowels, that accepts an array of letters (single character Strings) and returns an array of the same letters with all vowels removed.*

If you've already submitted and this wording change impacts your answer, you can correct and re-submit.

Susan
