# Issues

Github's Issues feature will serve as our &ldquo;questions and answers&rdquo; forum for this course.

<br>
When you run into problems or questions regarding course topics or projects, you should post your question in the Issues section of the course notes repository.

+ __Full URL: <https://github.com/susanBuck/dwa15-fall2017/issues>__
+ __Shortcut URL: <http://issues.dwa15.com>__

<br>
By sharing information via Issues, we'll all benefit from the collective knowledge of the class and avoid repeat questions.

Traditionally, Github's Issues feature is used for documenting problems, feature requests, etc. in a specific software project. For example, you can see the [Issues board for Laravel here](https://github.com/laravel/framework/issues). The Github Issues featureset, however, is also perfect for a course setting such as this, so not only will we take advantage of those features, we'll also gain practice using a real world software development tool.


## Policies
+ You can post questions regarding project development (including code and repository URLs), course curriculum and notes, and the &ldquo;to-dos&rdquo; you'll be completing each week.
+ There's a portion of the weekly progress logs that can *not* be discussed in the Issues forum; this portion will be clearly marked on the log template.
+ Do not post questions about course logistics (due dates, grades, policies, etc.) - these questions should be emailed to the instructor (susanbuck@fas.harvard.edu).
+ The primary purpose of Issues is to create a space where classmates can help each other out. However, completing your work is your own responsibility and if a solution is not reached for one of your posts, this is not an excuse for incomplete work.

## Search first for quicker resolutions
Posting in the course Issues should not be your first stop in solving a problem. Instead, sites like Google, [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) and the [Laravel Forum](http://laravel.io/forum) are necessary resources that can often give you an immediate answer to the problem at hand.

If you can't find your answer there, *then* search the course Issues to see if anyone else is having a similar problem which has already been solved (or is in the process of being solved).

If you can't find your solution, *then* post a new Issue.


## Getting help effectively
One of the skills you'll be working on in this class is how to articulate technical problems; this is an essential skill for any programmer. The more information you can provide, the quicker your peers will be able to help you.

The following is a quick summary of guidelines to help you build good posts.

* Take time to cleanly format your posts using proper Markdown syntax, code blocks, etc.; the more organized a post is, the easier it will be for us to help you. (Markdown will be addressed in the first week of the semester).
* Use informative post titles:
    * Bad: *Code won't work! Help!*
    + Good: *error "unable to open input stream" on upload*
* Include your Github URL to the revelant repository and __make sure your code is up to date__. We can most effectively help you when we can replicate the problem on our own system.
* Describe what behavior you are expecting and how it is different from the behavior are you actually receiving.
* Include relevant errors and exceptions.
* Include relevant code snippets.
* Include relevant/useful screenshots.
* Include any relevant environment details (live server, local server, Windows, Mac, etc.).
