# Course Policies

## &ldquo;Attendance&rdquo;
It is the student's responsibility to keep up with all weekly tasks (watching lecture videos, completing progress logs, etc.) in a timely matter. Because this course moves fast and builds on itself, falling behind on videos or work would be detrimental to your success in this course.


## Workload
Students often ask how much time they'll have to spend in order to be succesful in this course. This question is difficult to answer as it depends on many factors: how much previous experience you have, how quickly you pick up on technical topics, and how much you want to push yourself on your projects. Because of the diversity of experience of HES students, the range of time spent on course material varies greatly.

A classic college estimate says that students should expect to spend 3 hours on work outside of class for every hour spent &ldquo;in class&rdquo; (which in this case we'll define as the time spent watching lecture videos). Given this, we can estimate:

> `(3hrs x approx. 2hrs of lecture videos) + 2hrs to watch lecture videos = 8 hours per week`

You should consider this time estimate an average, as the workload will fluctuate throughout the semester. E.g. earlier in the semester, it may only take you 1 hour to complete that week's work, but in weeks leading up to a project completion you may spend more than 6 hours.

A select number of students will struggle in this course and pour many hours into their work. Typically this is a sign that the given student did not have enough programming experience coming into this course. If you feel you fall into this category, be sure to double check the pre-requisites before enrolling. If you're already enrolled and you find yourself in this situation, reach out to me so we can discuss.

Regardless of your experience level, some weeks may just demand a lot of your time if you encounter a lot of road blocks. Unfortunately, this is the nature of working with code/technology and even the most experienced programmer will hit road-blocks and spend far more time on a task than they anticipated. You can help minimize the time spent on road-blocks by:

+ not getting behind in course material
+ carefully following instructions
+ starting work early
+ posting effective questions (question asking strategies are [covered here](/issues) under *Getting help effectively*)


## Original work and academic integrity
All the projects you complete for this course should be of your own creation, authored specifically for this course.

The internet is full of tutorials and examples for the kind of applications you'll be creating. Aside from the serious academic consequences, to build your projects based on these found examples would only be cheating yourself from the experience of completing the work.

This is not to say you can't use outside resources as guidance&mdash; the ability to troubleshoot and seek out answers is one of the learning goals of this course. Just think carefully about the kind of help you're looking for in your searches.

For example:
+ Safe search: *&ldquo;how do I round a number up in php&rdquo;*
+ Dangerous search: *&ldquo;php tip calculator&rdquo;*

The first example is specific to one small component of an application, while the latter example is likely to lead you to code that you should be writing on your own.

Also be smart about looking at a classmate's project repository. Again, one of the goals of this course is to collaborate with others and because of that, we use public repositories and freely share code for troubleshooting purposes. That being said, there is an obvious line between looking at a classmate's code to help them troubleshoot their specific problem, and looking at a classmate's code because you can't figure out something in your own project. The former is encouraged, while the latter is unacceptable.

Red flags that may cause us to have concern about the originality of your project's code:
+ Code is designed in a way that is noticibly different than the approaches used in lecture.
+ Code is of a noticibly different quality than other code we've seen from you.
+ Code appears to be the result of following a step-by-step online tutorial.
+ Code shows high similarity to other code using [Standford's Measure Of Software Similarity program](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss).

__Work that raise concerns of originality may be submitted to the HES academic board for review.__


## Collaboration policy
While __project repositories are public__, your __weekly progress logs are private__ and should not be shared with classmates. For more on this read [Grading](/grading): *Collaboration*.
