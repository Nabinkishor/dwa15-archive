# Chat

A chat room for this course can be accessed via Gitter (a chat platform built around Github repositories).

+ __Full URL: <https://gitter.im/susanBuck/dwa15-fall2017>__
+ __Shortcut URL: <http://chat.dwa15.com>__

To participate in this chat, you'll be prompted to log in with your Github account.

It is not required that you use the course chat; it is only provided for those students who wish to interact in real-time with classmates and the instructor.

## Policies
+ You can post questions regarding project development (including code and repository URLs), course curriculum and notes, and the &ldquo;to-dos&rdquo; you'll be completing each week.
+ There's a portion of the weekly progress logs that can *not* be discussed in the Chat; this portion will be clearly marked on the log template.
+ Do not chat about course logistics (due dates, grades, policies, etc.) - these questions should be emailed directly to the instructor ({{ config('mail.instructor') }})
