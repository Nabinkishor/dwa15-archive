# Grading
The grading scheme for this course is additive&mdash; you earn points by completing thorough, thoughtful, and on-time work that demonstrates your progression in the course and a strong understanding of the curriculum.

Over the course of the semester, you can earn up to **700 points**.

The points are broken down each week with **50 points allocated per week**.

>> 14 weeks x 50 points = 700 total points

You will work toward your 50 weekly points by completing **weekly progress logs**.

The progress logs are designed to guide you through the course and 4 projects via a combination of open-ended prompts and comprehension checks.



## Weekly progress logs
Each Wednesday I will post a template for that weekâ€™s progress log at the same time that I post the lecture videos. To find this template, you'll go to [Schedule](/schedule) and click on the relevant week. Instructions for completing the log will be found in the template.

The __deadline for each log is 11:59pm Eastern Wednesday the week after it was posted__. Logs that are submitted before the deadline will earn 5 points reserved for timeliness.

Late logs can only be submitted up to 1 week past the deadline, but can not earn the 5 points reserved for timeliness.

Here's a summary of the timeline for a given week:

Points aside, it is imperative that you keep up with the weekly logs and the course material. This course moves fast and the material is cumulative, so getting behind on just one week of material can be detrimental to your success in the course.




## Projects
Over the course of the semester you will complete 4 projects. Projects 1-3 are structured tasks, which will be outlined in lecture. Project 4 is more open-ended and will be an opportunity to get creative with the tools you're learning this semester.

The grading and assessment of each project will be rolled into the weekly progress logs, which will guide you through the development of each project. Given this, the progress logs for weeks in which you're expected to have completed a project may be lengthier.



## Collaboration
In this course progress logs are private while projects are public.

__Progress logs are private:__ You can not share or collaborate with other students on progress logs. There's a portion of the weekly progress logs that can *not* be discussed in the Issues forum or course chat; this portion will be clearly marked on the log template.

__Projects are public__: Your Github project repositories will be public, and students are encouraged to work together when troubleshooting, especially in Github Issues. That being said, do not abuse the public nature of project repositories in order to complete your own projects by copying a classmate's code. For more on this, please read [Policies](/policies): *Original work and academic integrity*.
