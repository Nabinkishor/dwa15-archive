Markdown is a popular syntax format for styling text. On Github, you'll see Markdown used in their **Issues** and **Wiki** tools. Markdown is also commonly used to format code documentation and README.md files. Furthermore, Markdown is also used on popular software Q&A forums like [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com).

In short&mdash; Markdown is an essential tool for modern software developers, and thus it's one of the tangental skills you'll need in this course.

If you don't already know Markdown, fret not&mdash; it's a simple syntax language and shouldn't take more than a half hour to learn and master.

To dig into Markdown read through this quick guide: [Github: Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown).

Before you start, though, go to the [Issues](https://github.com/susanBuck/dwa15-fall2017/issues) forum for this course and click *New Issue* on the top right. Here you can draft an Issue and practice with Markdown syntax. You don't actually have to post the Issue, so don't worry about the content. As you're writing, switch between **Write** and **Preview** to see how your post is being styled.
