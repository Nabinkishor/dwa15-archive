## Submit projects

Projects are turned in via Canvas by submitting the URL to your project's repository on Github. Do *not* submit your site's URL (that should be in your `README.md` file, so we'll find it there).

## On making changes to your project after submitting...

We determine if a project is late by looking at when it was submitted *and* also by looking for any significant commits being made to your project after the due date.

It's okay to make minor commits after a project has been submitted (fixing typos, spiffing up some CSS, adjusting some copy, etc.).

If we see significant commits coming in after the due date (adding features or other requirements, etc.) we will assume that project was not complete at the time of submission.

Occasionally a student may discover a bug after they submitted and they'll want to commit a fix for it. That's okay too, again, assuming it's not significant. Bug fixes will not be accepted after the TA has graded your project.


## Project feedback/grades

Feedback and grades for projects submitted by the deadline will be available in Canvas 7 days after the project deadline (unless otherwise announced). If you submit late, you feedback will be delayed.

[Here's a screenshot](http://dwa15.com.s3.amazonaws.com/viewing-feedback@2x.png) showing how to access your feedback/grades once they have been completed.
