# Office hours and progress log reminder

Hi everyone&mdash; two quick FYIs:

## 1) Office hours
I've published the office hours I'll be holding this semester.

Details here: <http://dwa15.com/office-hours>

(Note: First office hours are online tonight Mon 5:30-7:30pm).

## 2) Progress log reminder
Reminder that your week 1 progress log should be submitted in Canvas before this Wed @ 11:59pm Eastern. This is a weekly deadline so mark it on your calendars&mdash; I won't be sending out future reminders regarding this.
