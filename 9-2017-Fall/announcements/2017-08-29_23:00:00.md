# Welcome to Dynamic Web Applications (CSCI E-15) Fall 2017

Hi everyone,

Welcome to the Fall 2017 Semester of Dynamic Web Applications (CSCI E-15). I'm Susan Buck (you can call me Susan) and I'll be your instructor for this course. I'm looking forward to working with you all.

To kick things off, I have some general info to share:

+ The home base for this course is <http://dwa15.com>.
+ Lecture videos and weekly material will be posted every Wednesday evening by 8pm Eastern Time.
+ To access weekly material, you'll go to <http://dwa15.com> > [Schedule](http://dwa15.com/schedule) and click on the current week. A Github login is required to access this material, so if you don't already have an account you'll need to create one.

Those are the essentials for now. I'll be sharing all the details you'll need to know for this course in the Week 1 info, to be posted Wed @ 8pm Eastern.

Once again, looking forward to &ldquo;meeting&rdquo; you all and hope it's a great semester!

-Susan
