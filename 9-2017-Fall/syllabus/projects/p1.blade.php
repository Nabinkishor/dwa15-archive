# Project 1

For this small, proof of concept project, you will create a single page website that displays the following information:

+ Your name
+ A photo of yourself. If you have privacy concerns about putting a photo of yourself online, you can use an alternative image (of your pet, a cartoon, whatever).
+ A brief paragraph introducing yourself (what do you do, what brings you to this course, etc.). I'll be compiling a list of P1s to share with the course so note that this information will be public.
+ A random quote generated with PHP.

__Example__: <a href='http://p1.dwa15.me' target='_blank'>http://p1.dwa15.me</a>


## Goals
+ Demonstrate that you have sucessfully set up the development workflow we'll use this semester.
+ Demonstrate your foundational HTML/CSS skills necessary for this course.
+ Provide some information about yourself so we can get to know you.
+ Practice a little bit of PHP.


## Finalizing
+ This project will be finalized in the Week 2 progress log which is due before Sep 13 @ 11:59pm.
+ You do not need to officially submit your project&mdash; I'll prompt for all the necessary details in the Week 2 progress log template.


## Requirements
+ Accessible via `http://p1.yourdomain.com`.
+ Use a minimimal amount of external CSS to cleanly style the page; it does not have to be a work of art, but I do want you to demonstrate you are comfortable with CSS. You can, *but don't have to*, use CSS tools like Bootstrap, SASS, etc.
+ You should use modern and semantic HTML; running your site's live URL through the [w3 validator](https://validator.w3.org) should produce no errors. Any known/unavoidable errors should be explained in your progress log.
+ Quote feature...
    + Should be powered by PHP.
    + Should randomly pull from a selection of at least 3 different quotes each page load.
    + The purpose of this requirement is to a) confirm your servers can run PHP, and b) give you an opportunity to practice the initial PHP info assigned as readings during Week 2.

#### System
+ Application should be in its own Github repository (do not put multiple projects in the same repo).
+ Repository should be public; if you have an exception that requires a private repository, please email me.
+ Site on production should match what is in your repository; i.e. do not make direct edits to your production code bypassing version control.

#### Presentation
+ Site's interface and design should be clear and organized.
+ There should be no accessibility/design issues (e.g. super small font, yellow text on a white background, etc.).
+ Site should load in <= 2 seconds.
+ Copy/text should use proper English and be void of typos.
+ Any graphics/images should be of good qualityâ€” there should be no pixelated, blurry, distorted, or otherwise low quality images.
+ Layout and interface should look presentable on laptop/desktop resolution (responsive design is welcome, but not required).

#### Code
+ Code should be organized, tidy, and easy to follow.
+ Code should be consistently and accurately indented.
+ Any extraneous code (including old, commented-out code) should be removed before completion.
+ There is some CSS applied.
+ Any CSS or JS should be external. Embedded CSS/JS is acceptable only in the case of one page sites. Inline CSS/JS is not acceptable.
+ Proper HTML structure should be used.



#### Misc
- Follow any/all other best practices not explicitly mentioned above but discussed in lecture/notes.
