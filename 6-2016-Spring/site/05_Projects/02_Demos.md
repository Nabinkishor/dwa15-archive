You are required to create a short screencast demo for all 4 projects in this course.

Screencasts should no longer than 5 minutes and should include your screen in addition to your voice narration as you walk through your project.

Your screencast must be made available online via a URL which is shared via your [README.md](http://dwa15.com/Projects/README) file.


## Demo outline and example
Here's a rough outline of what the walk-through of your project should look like:

* What is the title of your application?
* What is the main purpose of goal of your application?
* Walk us through the application, describing and using the features as you go.

Time permitting...

* If there are technical aspects of your project you wish to highlight, you can briefly talk about how they were executed and even show relevant code snippets from your repository.
* Describe any challenges or issues you faced.
* Describe any features you'd like to see added to your project that you might not have been able to complete.

__P1 exception:__ P1 is a &ldquo;proof of concept&rdquo; project, so there's not much to demo. However, you're still required to create a demo. See the P1 project description for more details of what is expected in that demo.


## Making/Sharing your video.
There are many free software programs you can use to make your screencasts. Below are a couple suggestions.

__Jing__
Available for both Mac/PC. After you record your video, Jing will give you the option to upload the video to their servers on Screencast.com. When the upload is complete you'll be given a URL to your video that looks something like this: `http://screencast.com/t/xad2f23842`. Do not try and upload your Jing video files to YouTube (it won't work).

__QuickTime + YouTube__
[Apple has instructions](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH5882?locale=en_US) on how to use QuickTime to record your screen. Past students have reported that the audio takes a few seconds to start recording when use QuickTime, so let the recording roll for a few seconds before you start talking.

Once you're done recording with QuickTime, you can upload it to YouTube (or any other online video sharing platform) to get a URL to share in your README file.


### Tips
+ Do not wait until the last minute to do your screencasts in case there are technical difficulties.
+ Whatever software you end up using, do a short test run first.
+ If either of the above two software options does not work for you due to software incompatibility issues, try Googling for *&ldquo;free screencast software for [insert your operating system here]&rdquo;* or post to Piazza asking for some recommendations from your classmates.
