The following expectations, referred to as *base expectations*, are points that are universal to all 4 projects.

In addition to these base expectations, each project will also have expectations specific to that particular project.

You can see the **[rubric we'll use to assess projects](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10FYbg-C8CoImgNgNm8xaugXbE6LPXI9fhEkYetRzUMM/edit#gid=0)** to get a clear picture of how your project will be graded. 

## Submission
* When submitting in Canvas, submit the Github URL for your project, *not* the live URL for your project.
* Your URLs should follows these naming conventions:
	+ `http://p1.yourdomain.com`
	+ `http://p2.yourdomain.com`
	+ `http://p3.yourdomain.com`
	+ `http://p4.yourdomain.com`
* Your `README.md` file should be present and complete ([more details...](/Projects/README)).
* Your demo should be present and complete ([more details...](/Projects/Demos)).
+ Make sure all work remains online, functioning, and in the same location where it was submitted for the duration of the semester.


## Version Control
* Each project should be in its own repository on Github (i.e. do not put multiple projects in the same repo).
* Your repos should show a history of at least three commits (1 at project start, at least 1 check-in during development and 1 at project completion). Three is the _bare_ minimum; we actually suggest you have many commits as you progress.
* Your repos should be public; if you have an exception that requires a private repository, please notify your TA.
* The product we see on your site should match the code we see in your repos; i.e. do not make direct edits to your production code bypassing version control.


## Presentation
* Each project should have a clear title/heading or logo that is present on every page. If your site has multiple pages, the header should always link to the homepage.
+ It should be clear what the purpose of the site is and/or how to use it. Assume your site will be viewed by an audience outside of this class.
* Your project's interface and design should be clear and organized.
+ You should avoid design and accessibility pitfalls (e.g. super small font, or yellow text on a white background).
+ All pages on your site should load quickly (3 seconds or less). If there are special circumstances why it takes longer (e.g. you're pinging an external API that is slow), make note of this in your README.md file.
* Double check for [typos](https://www.w3.org/2002/01/spellchecker), broken links, broken images, or error pages.
* Make sure all images are of a decent quality&mdash; avoid pixelated, blurry, distorted, or otherwise low quality images.
* You are welcome but not required to make your design responsive. Your layout and interface should look presentable on the average laptop/desktop resolution.
* Make sure there are no layout or design issues that cause important parts of your application to be obscured or unusable (e.g. an error message that appears and covers the submit button).

Suggestion: Try to observe at least 2 friends use your site (on their computers) before submitting; they may discover pitfalls in your sites function or design that you didn't notice on your own.


## Code
* Code should be organized, neat, and easy to follow.
* You should write [DRY (Do Not Repeat Yourself)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself) code with clear [Separation of Concerns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) (both of these topics will be addressed in lecture).
* Excessive commented out code from the debugging process should be removed before submitting.
* Your code should be properly indented.
* You should not use inline CSS or JS (if there are special circumstances why you need to use inline, discuss first with your TA).
* Your site should have no errors when run through the [W3 validator](https://validator.w3.org/), and you should use modern HTML (no deprecated tags, etc.).
* Your code should follow naming conventions outlined in lecture.
* The naming of functions, variables, classes, etc. should be thoughtful. Example of bad names: `doSomething()`, `my_number`, etc. ([suggested reading](http://mojones.net/how-to-pick-bad-function-and-variable-names.html)).
* Breaking any best practices discussed in lectures are subject to deductions.


## Languages
* You are welcome, but not required, to use __JavaScript__ in your projects (in addition to, not in place of PHP).
* You must use __PHP__ as your server language for P2, P3, P4, with __Laravel__ as your framework (P3, P4).
* Code, comments and README files must be written in English. If your site is intended for a non-English audience, you're welcome to display the copy in a language other than English, as long as Google Translate is able to translate it sufficiently enough for us to use the site when grading.
