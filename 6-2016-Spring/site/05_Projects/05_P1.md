## P1: System Setup / Portfolio

There are a few different goals for this first project:

1. Ensure your Git and server workflow is in working order.
2. Set up a portfolio to present all the projects you'll complete in this course.
3. Refresh your HTML/CSS skills if needed.


## Task
Create a single page website using basic HTML and CSS with the following information:

+ Your name
+ A photo of yourself
+ Placeholder links for Project 2, 3 and 4. Include a placeholder for both the live URL of the project as well as the Github URL.

## Example
* <http://p1.dwa15.com>

## Optional Extras
* Use a front-end framework such as [PureCSS](http://purecss.io/), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) or [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/).
* Make it look nice.
* Add any other info you'd like.

## P1 Demo
P1 is mainly a &ldquo;proof of concept&rdquo; project, so there's not much to demo. However, you're still required to create a demo so that (a) you work out any screencast-making kinks before P2, P3, P4, and (b) your TA has an opportunity to get to know you.

Given that, in addition to showing your working P1, you should also answer the following questions during your demo:

+ What is your name as listed with HES and what you prefer to be called (if different than what is listed)?
+ What do you do?
+ Why are you taking this course?
+ Anything else you'd like to share
