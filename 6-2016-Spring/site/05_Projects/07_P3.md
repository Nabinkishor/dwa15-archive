## P3: Laravel Basics
The goal of this project is to give you hands-on practice with working with the essentials of building a Laravel-based site. In building this project you'll demonstrate an understanding of the following skills:

* Creating a new Laravel application.
* Installing and using Composer packages.
* Routing basics.
* Views.
* Deploying a Laravel app on a live server.




## Task
Create a web application called *Developer's Best Friend* which includes a **Lorem Ipsum Generator** and a **Random User Generator**.

Your landing page should include a description of your app with either links to the two tools, or with the two tools present on the page.

The tools should be powered by HTML forms where the user can specify how many paragraphs they want, how many users they want, etc.

For your lorem ipsum text, you can use a Package such as [badcow/lorem-ipsum](https://packagist.org/packages/badcow/lorem-ipsum).

For your random users, you can use a Package such as [fzaninotto/faker](https://packagist.org/packages/fzaninotto/faker).

These packages are just suggestions; you're welcome to use others or write your own functionality.

Your forms should be checked by __server-side validation__. This is a feature you'll add towards the end of building your project when we get to validation with Laravel in Lecture 7 (two weeks before the P3 due date).


## Examples
* <http://p3.dwa15.com>
* <http://lipsum.com>
* <http://cupcakeipsum.com>
* <http://randomuser.me>




## Optional Extras
* Give the option to include extra info for the generated users, such as birthdate, location, a small profile blurb, etc.
* Add your xkcd generator from p1 (not just a link&mdash; actually work the code into your Laravel app).
* Add a new feature: Permissions calculator (inspiration: <http://permissions-calculator.org/>)
* Etc...
