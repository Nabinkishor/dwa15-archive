Lecture videos will be posted every Thursday by 5:30pm Eastern.

You are encouraged to watch the videos as soon as possible so you have sufficient time to work on the class tasks for the week.

## Accessing the videos
Videos will be posted in Canvas

Log into Canvas, find this course (CSCI E-15), and then find the *Lecture Videos* link from the navigation on the left.

Each week, you'll see links for the videos there.
