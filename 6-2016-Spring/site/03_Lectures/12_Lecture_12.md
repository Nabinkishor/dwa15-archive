## Housekeeping
+ A look at the schedule
    + Today is our last lecture of new essential content
    + You should be digging heavily into P4
+ Reminder: P4 Planning Doc Phase 2 (Database Tables) due before *next lecture* (Thu Apr 28 @ 5:30pm Eastern)
    + You do not need to resubmit your planning document, just update the existing copy.
    + TAs will not be re-checking documents; if you want specific feedback you can ping your TA.
+ Correction to Author model from last week&mdash; the `book()` method should be plural (`books()`).
