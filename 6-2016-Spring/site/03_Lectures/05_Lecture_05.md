## To-do

__[ ] Update your foobooks__
Following along with the class foobooks example, set up the routes and controller as we did in lecture today.

__[ ] Read: [CodeBright: Primer](http://daylerees.com/codebright-the-primers/)__

This reading is from a book written for Laravel 4, however this particular chapter (&ldquo;Primer&rdquo;) is very good and still applies in Laravel 5.

Covered in this reading are three topics: **Namespacing**, **JSON** and **Composer**. These topics aren't specific to Laravel, but are used throughout Laravel.

The only bit of information in this chapter that *is* outdated between L4 and L5 is in the section on Composer&mdash; in L5 PSR-4 autoloading is used, rather than PSR-0 which this reading discusses. The same principles between these two autoloading methods apply, though, they're just executed slightly differently. The difference is beyond the scope of what we need to focus on right now, but you can [read more here](http://www.sitepoint.com/battle-autoloaders-psr-0-vs-psr-4/) if interested.

Here are key points you should take away from this reading:

+ What is the purpose of Namespacing?
+ What is the purpose of JSON?
+ What does the basic structure/syntax of JSON look like?
+ In addition to data transfer, what can JSON be used for?
+ What is the purpose of Composer?
+ What is the purpose of `composer.json`?
+ What is the `require` section of composer.json used for?
+ What is autoloading?
+ Via Composer, what are 3 methods of autoloading?
