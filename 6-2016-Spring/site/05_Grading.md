## Participation
Working in web development is rarely a solitary job. In real world work environments you will find yourself interacting with teams, clients, and peers where you will have to learn to effectively communicate technical problems and ideas.

Even if you work independently, you will find yourself using industry resources like StackOverflow where strong communication skills are essential.

To practice your technical communication skills, one of your responsibilities in this course is to be an active member on Piazza, helping your peers troubleshoot their problems and providing constructive feedback when applicable.

Not only will this practice sharpen your technical communication skills, you'll be amazed by how much you learn when you help others.

### How participation is evaluated

Participation is evaluated at the end of the semester on a scale of 0-5 points.

Your participation grade is primarily determined by your engagement with Piazza; here are examples of contributions that will help your participation grade:

+ Most important: Helping your peers troubleshoot their issues. You don't have to necessarily know the answer, but sometimes just posting suggestions on things to check/try can be useful.
+ Asking clear, well-documented questions.
+ Posting a note about an issue you ran into and how you resolved it.
+ Posting a tip or resource supplemental to the course material.

To get a sense on how active you are in Piazza relative to your classmates, view the **Statistics** tab in Piazza.

While engagement in Piazza is the primary indicator of your participation grade, consideration is also given to how active you are in Slack/sections. Which isn't to say you're required to do either, just that if you do it could compensate for lower Piazza participation.



## Project late penalties
+ 0 up to 20 hours late: hours% off (ex: if 3 hours late, that's 3% off; minutes are rounded up to the nearest hour)
+ 20+ hours up to 1 week past due: 20% off
+ 1 week up to 2 weeks past due: 30% off
+ 2 weeks to 3 weeks past due: 40% off
+ 3 weeks or later: Project not accepted, student will receive a 0.

Percentage is taken off of total possible points for the project.

If your submission is late, make sure you notify your TA so they're aware your project is ready for grading/feedback.

It is not the TA's responsibility to track down missing work or troubleshoot broken projects. Make sure you submit your work as instructed and that everything has been tested before submission.


### One Free Late Pass
Each student has one **late pass** for project submissions which will reduce your late deduction by 20%.

<img src='http://dwa15.com.s3.amazonaws.com/one-free-late-pass@2x.png' style='width:400px'>

If you need to use your late pass, you do not need to specify which project you wish to use it on&mdash; we will automatically calculate it for you at the end of the semester, applying it where it would be most beneficial to you.

__Example scenarios:__

+ You turn all your projects on time, except P1 is 3 days late. P1 should face a 20% deduction but your late pass is used to bring the deduction down to 0%.

+ You turn all your projects on time, except P1 is 13 days late. P1 should face a 40% deduction but your late pass is used to bring the deduction down to 20%.

+ You turn in P1 and P2 on time, but you turn P3 in 5 days late, and P4 in 5 days late. Your late pass is used on P4 (since it has a higher point weight) bringing its deduction down to 0%.

The late pass is provided to account for personal circumstances (computer crashes, health, job, religious holidays, family, etc.). Because of this, there will be **no late exceptions beyond this pass**.

This goal of this policy is to keep things fair amongst all students and prevents myself or the TAs from having to make time-consuming judgement calls on what individual circumstances merit exceptions.
