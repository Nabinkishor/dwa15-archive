In this course, we use a developer-focused chat system called __Slack__.

Our class slack lives at <https://dwa15-spring2016.slack.com>.

You can use Slack via their web interface but I suggest downloading a stand-alone app for an optimized experience: <https://slack.com/apps>.


### Invites
To join the class Slack, you will need to be invited. On the day that registration closes, I will send an invite to all registered students.

If you register late, or don't receive an invite for some other reason, email me at susanbuck@fas.harvard.edu to request an invite.



## #general
The `#general` channel is open to all students, and is available for general chatter.


## Private Channels
Private channels are used for section discussion where you communicate with your section-mates and TA. The private channels are named according to the TA's name (`pats_section`, `jennis_section`, etc.). Once sections are sorted out at the start of the semester, you'll be invited by your TA to join the appropriate section channel.


## Direct Messaging
Slack also has private, direct messaging. You're welcome to use this feature to message myself or the TAs in lieu of email.

That being said, keep in mind that many of us maintain other jobs in addition to working on this course, so the response rate will not always be instant and will be equivalent to the response rate you should expect from email.


## A note on troubleshooting in Slack
Slack is great for communicating with your classmates and TAs in real-time. For our virtual students, it's especially useful because it creates a sense of community.

That being said, Slack is not a substitute for posting troubleshooting questions in Piazza.

Because there may be a lot of traffic on Slack at times, it's possible troubleshooting queries might get lost in the flow, and we won't know if your issue has been resolved or not.


## Tip: Sharing code
In *Preferences*, under *Advanced Options*, check off the option that says __When typing code with ```, ENTER should not send the message.__.

Now, when you're sharing code snippets in the chat, you can begin and end the snippet with three backticks:

Doing this will make your code display in a readable, mono-spaced font:
