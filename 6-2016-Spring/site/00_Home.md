*Dynamic Web Applications* is the next step for students who have experience with HTML/CSS and are looking to take their web programming skills to the next level with **server-side web development**.

Websites can be relatively static mediums: a simple portfolio or a site for a local coffee shop are two examples of basic sites with hard-coded content. This format works well for presenting the same information to every visitor to the site. Web applications, however, take websites to the next level. Think about your experience with online banks, tools like Google Docs, or stores like Amazon. These are all robust applications operating with databases and offering a personalized experience to each individual user.

Over the course of the semester we'll cover the skills necessary to evolve simple static websites into dynamic, database-driven web applications.

**Technologies covered:**

* Object Oriented PHP using the expressive MVC framework, [Laravel](http://laravel.com)
* Basic server set up and management
* Version Control with Git
* Modern web development practices
