In this course, students are divided into sections, which is a cohort of roughly 25 students led by a single TA. The idea of sections is to facilitate smaller, more personal communities within the larger class.

Each section has a dedicated meeting time that occurs weekly:

+ Sun 8:30-10:30pm Andrew
+ Mon 8:30-10:30pm Rebekah
+ Wed 8:30-10:30pm Jenni

Sections will begin meeting on Sun Feb 14th (Andrew's section).

Rebekah *will* hold a section meeting on President's day (Mon Feb 15)


## What section am I in?
To find out what section you were assigned to, log into Canvas, go to the __People__ section and search for your name ([screenshot](http://dwa15.com.s3.amazonaws.com/seeing-section-assignments-in-canvas.png)).

A survey was sent out at the beginning of the semester to get student preferences for section meeting times; all efforts were made to cater to your top choices when possible, but some balancing was required.

If you did not take the survey, or have some issue with your final section assignment, don't panic. Email me and we'll discuss.

If you indicated on the survey that you did not plan to attend section meetings, you were still assigned to a section.


## The sections times being offered didn't fit my schedule, what can I do?
This course has about 75 students, which allots us 3 TAs/sections (25 students per TA).

Unfortunately, with 75 students it's nearly impossible to find 3 section times that will work for all 75 students, especially given the vast differences in our schedules and timezones. Given that, we picked section times that work for the greatest number of students.

Despite our best efforts, you may be one of the few students who is unable to attend any of the meeting times. To compensate for this, we will make recordings of section meetings available to all students. **These recordings will be available via this Piazza post: [Section Recordings](https://piazza.com/class/ij1mi6jtwxz1js?cid=50).**

Note that the section meetings are just one of the several outlets you have in this course for connecting with your TA and classmates. If you are unable to attend section meetings, you can still communicate via Piazza and Slack any time of the day.


## What happens in sections?
Sections meetings in this course are very relaxed; most of the time will operate as &ldquo;open office hours&rdquo; with your TA and section-mates, where you can bring in specific questions and get troubleshooting help.

Sometimes, though, a TA may decide to dedicate a portion of the section to a mini-lecture where they cover material to reenforce or supplement lecture material.

How section time is spent is up to the discretion of your TA and they will adjust depending on the needs of the students.


## How do I attend section?
Sections are run via web conferencing software called **WebEx**. This software will allow you, your section-mates, and your TA to talk and share your screens in real-time. There is also a chat feature if you want to participate but are not in a place where you can use your mic (for example, busy coffee shop, office, home with kids, etc.)

Each week, about 10 minutes before your section starts, your TA will share a link to the WebEx conference that you will join. This link will be shared via your section's private channel in Slack (`#jennis-section`, `#andrews-section`, `#rebekahs-section`). If you haven't already been invited to your section's private channel in Slack, contact me or your TA and we will invite you.

The first few times you use WebEx (if it's new to you), you may have to take some time to get familiar with the software. You may have to download some plugins, troubleshoot why your audio isn't working, etc. We've found this is par for the course for most web conference software, and in our various tests, WebEx has the *fewest* issues. That being said, it's not without kinks, so be patient, and don't be afraid to ask your TA for help.

Please use **headphones** during WebEx meetings to eliminate distracting echos.


## Can I attend a section I was not assigned to?
Generally it's best if you stick to the section you're assigned to so we can make sure attendance is balanced across all sections.

However, we understand some weeks your schedule might make it difficult to attend your assigned section.

If this happens and you want to &ldquo;sit in&rdquo; on another TA's section, that's fine, just drop them an email/Slack message to double check first. If TAs are at capacity with their students, they may deny your request, but in most cases they should be able to accommodate you.
