Hi everyone,
<br><br>
Welcome to the Spring 2016 Semester of Dynamic Web Applications. I'm Susan Buck and I'll be your instructor for this course. I'm looking forward to working with you all this semester.
<br><br>
To kick things off, I have some general info to share:

<br><br>
--- dwa15.com ---<br>
While we'll use several different tools in this course (all of which I'll explain), <a href='http://dwa15.com'>http://dwa15.com</a> is your main homebase. Consider it a very detailed and dynamic syllabus. If you haven't already, you can skim through the pages there to learn more about this course.

<br><br>
--- CLASS DAY ---<br>
Lecture videos for this course will be posted every Thursday by 5:30pm Eastern Time.

Even though you will all watch the videos at different times depending on your schedule, timezones, etc., we'll consider that our "class time" and many of the deadlines will coincide with that time.

You are encouraged to watch the lecture videos as soon as you can so you have plenty of time to complete the work you need to do each week.

<br><br>
--- LECTURE VIDEOS ---<br>
Lecture videos will be posted in Canvas.

Log into Canvas, find this course (CSCI E-15), and then go to the Pages section from the menu on the left.

Each week, you'll see links for the videos there.

This link should also take you directly there:

<br><br>
--- SLACK ---<br>
In this course, we'll use Slack chat for real-time communication.

Learn more about Slack here: <a href='http://dwa15.com/Slack_Chat'>http://dwa15.com/Slack_Chat</a>

I sent every registered student an invite to the class Slack; if you did not it receive it, send me an email (susanbuck@fas.harvard.edu).

<br><br>
--- PIAZZA ---<br>
In this course, we'll use Piazza to ask questions, talk about the material, and work together troubleshooting problems.

Learn more about Piazza here: <a href='http://dwa15.com/Piazza'>http://dwa15.com/Piazza</a>

I sent every registered student an invite to the class Piazza; if you did not it receive it, send me an email (susanbuck@fas.harvard.edu).

<br><br>
--------------
<br><br>
Those are the essentials for now. Stay tuned for Lecture 1 this Thursday where I'll be covering all the details you need to know for this course.
<br><br>
Once again, looking forward to "meeting" you all and hope it's a great semester!
<br><br>
