There are __two__ pre-requisites for this course:

1. You must have prior programming experience.
2. You must be comfortable with HTML/CSS and basic web site publishing.

Each of these pre-requisites is discussed in more detail below.





## Prior programming experience
It is expected that you come into this course with prior programming experience.

The language(s) you have experience with is flexible and may include: JavaScript, Java, PHP, Ruby, Python, any of the "C" varieties, etc.

Note that HTML and CSS (while required skills) do not qualify as programming experience because they are syntax languages, not programming languages.

In general, you should feel comfortable with the following basic programming paradigms:

+ Variables
+ Different data types like strings, integers, booleans, arrays, etc.
+ Conditional structures like if else statements
+ Loops
+ Functions
+ Classes and Objects

CSCI E-15 is not an introduction to programming. We will use programming to build web applications,
but we will not teach you to program.

If you take this course without prior programming experience, it would be akin to taking a course on writing novels without first having a fundamental understanding of spelling, vocabulary, sentence structure, etc.

The following courses at Harvard Ext. are examples of the kind of courses that would give you fundamental programming experiencing, preparing you for CSCI E-15:

+ CSCI E-3 Introduction to Web Programming Using JavaScript
+ CSCI E-7 Introduction to Programming with Python
+ CSCI E-10A Introduction to Computer Science Using Java I
+ CSCI E-50 Intensive Introduction to Computer Science

Your prior programming experience can also come from non-HES courses, self-taught study, on the job experience, etc.

The [prerequisite quiz](http://prereq.dwa15.com) includes basic programming questions to help your judge your preparedness for this course.


## HTML/CSS and basic web site publishing
It is expected that you come into this course with a strong grasp of modern HTML/CSS and basic web site publishing. Much of the work we do in CSCI E-15 builds upon these technologies, so prior understanding is necessary.

If you're unsure whether you're qualified, here are some bullet points you can check your skills against:

+ You can build a basic web site in HTML and CSS.
+ You know how to publish a site online, including working on a shared server and setting up a domain name.
+ You know what an HTML *tag*, *element* and *attribute* is, as well as the difference between these terms.
+ You understand why elements like `<font>` and `<center>` should no longer be used.
+ You know why page layouts should *not* be executed with HTML tables.
+ You know the difference between *absolute* and *relative* paths when setting up images, links, and linking assets (like CSS and JavaScript).
+ You know the difference between inline, internal and external CSS as well as the pros and cons of each.
+ You're not necessarily an expert at CSS layouts, but you understand the basics about how to position things on the page.

For HTML/CSS skills, Harvard Ext's __CSCI E-12 Fundamentals of Website Development__ is a logical precursor to CSCI E-15.

Your experience can also come from non-HES courses, self-taught study, on the job experience, etc.

The [prerequisite quiz](http://prereq.dwa15.com) includes HTML/CSS questions to help your judge your preparedness for this course.
