### Q2) How much time will I need to devote to this course?
This question is difficult to answer as it depends on many factors: how much previous experience you have, how quickly you pick up on technical topics, and most importantly, how much you want to push yourself on your projects.

If you'd still like a rough number, though, I'll defer to the classic college estimate: students should spend roughly 2-3 hours outside of class for every hour in class.




### Q3) I have to miss [x] lecture(s). Will this be a problem?
There are no point deductions in this course for missing lectures. Each student is responsible for their own attendance.
