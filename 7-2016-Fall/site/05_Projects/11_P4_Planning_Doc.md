## The purpose of the P4 Planning Doc
The options for P4 are pretty wide open, which gives you a lot of creative freedom. However, sometimes this freedom can be challenging for some students who &ldquo;bite off more than they can chew&rdquo; and have a difficult time completing a working project by the end of the semester.

To help with &ldquo;project bloat&rdquo;, one of your requirements for P4 is to build a Planning Doc. The purpose of this document is to get you to think through your application from start to finish, so you have a realistic roadmap to finish your application by the end of the semester.

## Steps
__Here is a Google Docs template you should use for your P4 Planning Doc: <http://bit.ly/p4-planning-doc>.__

On that Doc, you should go to __File__ then __Make a Copy__ to make a version for yourself which you can edit.

On your document, change the __Share__ settings so that it is __publicly viewable__ and anyone can __comment__ on it. These settings are required so that your TAs can view your plan and leave comments.

The above two steps are demonstrated in this video:

### Submitting
Refer to the course schedule for the due date of the P4 Planning Doc.

When you've completed your document, find the *P4 Planning Doc* assignment in Canvas and submit the URL to your doc.

You must also add a link to your planning doc from your P4 README.md file.


## Misc
+ It's okay to continue to edit your planning doc after this date as your project evolves. That's actually why I have you build this in Google Docs&mdash; so you can make edits even after submission. That being said, don't use this as crutch for submitting a incomplete Planning Doc.
+ Your TA will look at your planning doc and leave any feedback, if needed, via Google Doc comments. The comments may be as simple as *This looks good, you're on the right track!* or more in depth if they have concerns or suggestions to make your build smoother.
+ Feel free to reach out to your TA directly if you want to discuss your plan in more depth.
+ The planning document will count for a portion of your final P4 grade.
