To have an understanding of how your project will be graded, you can preview the rubric the TAs will use:

&rarr; __[Fall 2016 CSCI E-15 Rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZemsSZFdPPqzKM3kaamK_eGf3WcGOBiPzQlWjB3MEtY/edit#gid=1094381795)__


You'll note the rubric starts with a main sheet which summarizes your grades across all 4 projects, and also factors in [Above and Beyond criteria](/Projects.../Above_and_Beyond_criteria) as well as late deductions.

Then, each project has the following sheets (where `X` is the project number):

+ `PX`: Used to mark adherence to **project specific** requirements.
+ `PX Base:` Used to mark adherence to **[base expectation](/Projects.../Base_Expectations)** requirements.
+ `PX Comments:` Used to record written comments/feedback.

__This rubric is presented in advance for informational purposes and is subject to minor adjustments before being used on a project. Any changes made to the rubric will only be to more accurately reflect the project descriptions; we will not throw you any curveballs.__
