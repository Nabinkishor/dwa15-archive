> *&ldquo;Above and Beyond: 5% of the total points is reserved for projects that demonstrate extraordinary distinction, awarded at the discretion of the TA and instructor. According to the [HES letter grade scale](https://www.extension.harvard.edu/resources-policies/exams-grades-transcripts/grades), &lsquo;A&rsquo; projects demonstrate &lsquo;extraordinary distinction&rsquo;; this category is used in the spirit of awarding that distinction.*

The Above and Beyond criteria resulted from discussion between myself and TAs over various semesters of grading projects. I continually heard feedback from the TAs that they felt like they were unable to reward the students who were doing exceptional work. From these conversations, I suspected that, like many university courses, this one was facing a case of grade inflation:

> *&ldquo;Under regular inflation, prices can rise without limit. However, because grades are capped at A or A+, grade inflation results in a greater concentration of students at the top of the distribution. This compression of grades diminishes their value as an indicator of student abilities. Without grade inflation, a truly outstanding student might be awarded an A, while a very good student might receive a B+. With grade inflation, both students receive As, making it hard for employers and graduate schools to differentiate them. There is also evidence that lenient grading reduces student effort.&rdquo;*

The Above and Beyond criteria is a distinguishing grade to award truly exceptional projects, usually given to about 10% of students, give or take. If you did not receive this distinction, it does not mean that your project was not really good, it just means it was not in the top 10%. A generous number of students in this course will earn an A. The Above and Beyond criteria is used to distinguish amongst those A students.

__Regarding how to earn the Above and Beyond criteria:__
The expectations for earning an A on projects is clear. If you meet those expectations and you earned an A, you should be proud of that. In terms of getting the extra 5%, though, there is no set formula we can share to assure you get the point(s) next time, and we don't want to hold student's hands to make sure they all get it, as this would defeat the purpose of the criteria.

After each project, I will share notable projects from a select number of students, which will give you an indicator of how the Above and Beyond projects stand out.

__Regarding completing the *Optional Extras* ideas from the project descriptions:__
Tackling some (or all) of the items listed under *Optional Extras* from the project descriptions does not necessarily equate to getting your project in the top 10%. These challenges are provided as ideas and encouragement for how you could further challenge yourself if you find the base expectations easy to accomplish.

Above and Beyond projects often go beyond these *Extra Challenge* ideas, when students explore in their own direction and end up with something extra-special, not for point purposes, but as a result of curiosity.

<br>
__Regarding extra front-end/design effort:__
You may note that some (but not all) of the notable projects have a very strong design, but this does not directly correlate to them being considered exceptional. In many projects, students implemented Bootstrap, responsive design, and other front-end flare. We appreciate seeing this polished effort, but it does not guarantee the A&B category, since more than 10% of students typically take this step.

Furthermore, while the design skills and the technologies used to accomplish these extras are challenging, they are not directly related to the curriculum of this course.
