## P4: Final
The final project should bring together all the skills we've learned throughout the semester to create a fully functioning web application that uses PHP, Laravel, and a database.

To help you plan and build P4, you are required to create a __P4 Planning Doc__. [More details about that here...](/Projects.../P4_Planning_Doc)

## Task
This project is open-ended. Whatever you create, the main expectation is that the project meets the following criteria:

* Uses PHP/Laravel.
* Uses a database with at least __2 tables__. This count *does not* include a `users` table, but *does* include pivot tables.
* Demonstrates __all 4 CRUD interactions__ (user signup/login does not count towards this).
* Demonstrates server-side error validation.

If you started this course at a more advanced level and your confidence in the material is high, you are encouraged to create an application of your choosing.

If you want a bit more guidance, you're welcome to use the *Task Manager* spec below as your project subject.


## Examples of past student projects

+ [__BoardHoarder__](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dECfvnTsV5U) by William Burgess
    + Item organizer for boardgames. Users can create, read, update and delete games and various related information to the collection, and can curate their own listing of games by 'hoarding' and tagging those games.
    <!-- https://github.com/andyburgess/csci_e15_p4 -->
+ [__Education Equipment Circulation__](https://youtu.be/bfnx6WXnRsY) by Kriss Barnhart
    + A tool to help the Distance Education office track Equipment. Featured an interface for users to check in/out equipment and an interface for admins to manage equipment. Neat feature: Kriss printed barcodes for items and was used a barcode reader to input equipment info.
+ [__Magnetic Poetry__](https://youtu.be/h-L4bLaa_6w) by Lauren Middleton
    + A online interface that mimics the experience of [magnetic poetry](http://magneticpoetry.com/). Users can drag and drop words to create new poems, save poems, and edit existing poems.
+ [__Chirper__](https://youtu.be/TVmbhJp9PIc) by Johanna Bodnyk
    + Microblogging platform similar to Twitter.
+ [__Gift Guru__](https://youtu.be/Tl3ZsS9rVQ0) by Adam Pacelli
    + Gift wish list manager. Neat features: Ties into Amazon, sharable URLs to share lists.
+ [__Judith's Kitchen__](https://youtu.be/If9bUABPJjQ) by Kate de Bethune
    + Site for a cafe that offers high-quality, fresh prepared foods, sandwiches, soups, salads, and baked goods. The site allows for online ordering from the cafe's catering menu.

## Sample Project Idea: Task Manager

Should include:

* User authentication so different users can have their own task lists.
* A page to display all incomplete tasks.
* A page to display all completed tasks.
* A page to display all tasks with incomplete tasks in bold and completed tasks greyed out.
* A page to add new tasks.
* A page to edit the content of existing tasks.

Whenever a task is displayed, it should list the date it was created and if complete, when it was completed.

Use error checking: Don't allow empty tasks, don't allow duplicate email sign-ups, etc.

*Extra Challenges*

* Add the ability to edit the date of existing tasks.
* Add the option to email a task.
* Add/edit tasks via Ajax.
* Add the ability to login via OAuth.


## Misc

### Regarding whether your site needs to implement user authentication
All students are required to implement user authentication on their site, even if you don't need it to accomplish your site's goal.

For example, if you're creating a site that lets anonymous visitors vote on their favorite recipe each month, accommodating individual users is not necessarily needed.

If that is the case, think of some way in which authentication could be applied&mdash; perhaps you can have administrative users that can edit the recipes.


### Test user seeds
Your application seeds must include the following two test users (in addition to any other users you wish to seed), using these details, exactly as written:

Name: `Jill`
Email: `jill@harvard.edu`
Password: `helloworld`

Name: `Jamal`
Email: `jamal@harvard.edu`
Password: `helloworld` (all lowercase, no spaces)

The topic of Seeding is covered in Lecture 10, and User Authentication is covered in Lecture 12. Which means if you're reading this requirement before then, this won't make much sense right now. I'll remind you during those lectures about this requirement so you can revisit it later.
