It's common for software and code packages to include a `README.md` file in the root directory which contains basic information about the package such as author details, instructions for use, etc.

For projects hosted on Github, you can see the contents of the README file on the project's main Github page. For example, scroll down on <https://github.com/laravel/laravel> to see Laravel's README file.

It is required that each of your projects has its own `README.md` file in the root. Not only does this get you in the practice of writing the files, it will also provide necessary details for the teaching team when evaluating your project.

Here's the minimum content requirements for your `README.md`:

* Title of the project
* Live URL of the project.
* Description of the project (2-3+ sentences).
* Link to your screencast demo.
* Any details the instructor or TA needs to know about using your project.
* A list of any plugins, libraries, packages or outside code used in the project. See [Student Responsibilities](/Student_Responsibilities) for more details on avoiding code plagiarism.
* P4 Only:
    + Bulleted list of where we can see your 4 CRUD operations in action.
    + Link to Planning Doc.




## Format
`README.md` files are written using Markdown (hence the `.md` extension). Markdown is a simple syntax convention that lets you indicate things like headers, links, bullets, etc. Here's a  [Markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to refer to while writing your README file.

To make your life easier, I've put together an [example README.md file](https://gist.github.com/susanBuck/d5173196babd1cedfd06) you can use as a starting template. When you view the example, you're seeing the rendered Markdown; click the *Raw* button to see/copy the actual code.

Tips:

+ If you view your markdown (`.md`) files in the browser, you'll see the raw markdown text. However, when you view these same files in Github, they'll render properly.
+ To avoid having to repeatedly commit just to preview your README edits, you can compose your `README.md` file in a Markdown editor like <http://markdownlivepreview.com>.
