The goal of this project is to give you hands-on practice with working with the basics of PHP.

## Inspiration/Examples
* **[p2.dwa15.com](http://p2.dwa15.com)**
* [correcthorsebatterystaple.net](http://correcthorsebatterystaple.net/)
* [preshing on programming](http://preshing.com/20110811/xkcd-password-generator/)
* [secure, memorable password generator](https://www.xkpasswd.net/c/index.cgi)
* [Joel's Password Generator](http://jpgen.joelwalters.com/)

## Goals
* Form inputs to specify:
	* How many words to use.
	* Whether to include a number.
	* Whether to include a special symbol (for example, `@`).
* Basic server-side validation (for example, what happens if the user enters a string instead of a number to indicate number of words?). You can do client-side validation as well, but it is not a substitute for server-side validation.

## Optional Extras
* Add more configurations:
	* How many special characters.
	* Spaces or [camelCase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase) or hyphens.
	* Max length.
	* All upper case, or all lower case, or make the first letter of each word upper case.
	* Etc...
* Scrape an online word list to build a really long word list. (No clue where to start? [Here's an outline](https://gist.github.com/susanBuck/a81365a69d3a8649db0b) for approach).
* Etc...


## Time Estimate
