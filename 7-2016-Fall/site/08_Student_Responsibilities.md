The Summer 2014 session is an in-person course, with no video alternative and there is no complete substitute for missing a lecture.

It is especially important during a Summer semester to not miss any classes as the semester is compressed and we will be covering a lot of material in each meeting.

Also note that it's imperative that you are present for the first lecture so you have a complete understanding of the semester ahead. In addition to covering the structure of the course, we will begin with course curriculum from day one.

The following is Harvard Summer School's policy on missing the first class:
>> *Harvard Summer School does not condone students arriving after classes begin, and students who contact the Registrar's Office for permission to start online or on-campus classes late are denied. If a student contacts you for permission to miss your first class meetings, we advise against granting the request.*

-->

## Attendance
You are expected to be present for every lecture. In the case of online students, this translates to watching every lecture video.

If you miss a lecture, it is your own responsibility to visit the lectures notes and coordinate with a classmate to catch up on what you've missed.

*It is not the instructor or TA's responsibility to cover a lecture's worth of material for you if you are not present*. Taking time and resources to do this would be a disservice to the students who are in attendance.

Material will not be delivered ahead of time, but you are welcome to submit projects in advance of the due date if you anticipate being away.

## Course policies on original work and academic integrity

All the projects you submit for this course should be of your own creation, authored specifically for this course.

You are allowed to incorporate existing plugins or libraries that help facilitate your **original idea and execution**, but they should not be the focus of your project.

Any outside libraries or plugins used in your project need to be thoroughly documented in your project's README.md file with the following information:

* Name of plugin/library
* Location (github url, homepage, etc)
* How this plugin was used in your project


Examples of acceptable external code use:

* Using a PHP wrapper to interact with API, ex: [twitter-api-php](https://github.com/J7mbo/twitter-api-php)
* Implementing a JavaScript or PHP validation library
* Incorporating a [jQuery Knob Plugin](http://anthonyterrien.com/knob/) into your interface
* Using [jQuery DataTables](http://datatables.net/) to show tabular data
* Using widgets from jQuery UI
* Using Twitter Bootstrap


Example of unacceptable external code use:

* Building a timeline (and only a timeline) using <http://timeline.knightlab.com/>
* A project that was constructed by following an online tutorial, textbook, etc.

Any projects which we suspect do not meet the above guidelines and are unfairly taking from an outside source will be submitted for review to the administrative board.
