## To-do

__[ ] Update your foobooks__
Following along with the class foobooks example, set up the routes and controller as we did in lecture today.

__[ ] Read:__

Code Smart:

+ [Namespaces](https://daylerees.com/code-smart-namespaces)
+ [JSON](https://daylerees.com/code-smart-json/)
+ [Composer](https://daylerees.com/code-smart-composer/)

These topics aren't solely specific to Laravel, but are used throughout Laravel and thus, understanding them will make it easier to work with Laravel.

Here are key points you should take away from these readings:

+ What is the purpose of Namespacing?
+ What is the purpose of JSON?
+ What does the basic structure/syntax of JSON look like?
+ In addition to data transfer, what can JSON be used for?
+ What is the purpose of Composer?
+ What is the purpose of `composer.json`?
+ What is the `require` section of composer.json used for?
+ What is autoloading?
+ Via Composer, what are 3 methods of autoloading?

You may see questions on the quiz regarding the above questions, so be sure to do the readings before taking the Lecture 5 quiz.

__[ ] Plan/build necessary Routes and Controllers for P3__
You won't start filling out the logic of your action methods, but you can scaffold the routes and controllers you'll need.

__[ ] Take Lecture 5 quiz before next lecture.__
