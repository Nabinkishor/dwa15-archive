Lecture videos are available for remote students via the following two formats during the __Fall 2016__ semester:

## 1. Live stream
Lectures are streamed live on __Thursdays 5:30-7:30pm Eastern Time__.

To watch the live stream, visit the [HES CSCI E-15 Publication Listing](https://matterhorn.dce.harvard.edu/engage/ui/index.html#/2017/01/14291) (this page is also embedded in Canvas under *Lecture Videos*)

During the live stream, you'll see a link to watch the lecture above the list of recorded lectures.

Remote students are welcome to use our Slack chat to participate during the live lectures. Read the page on [Slack](Slack_Chat) for more details.


## 2. Recorded
If you miss the live stream, you also visit the *HES CSCI E-15 Publication Listing* page where recorded lectures will be posted.

Because of necessary production time, HES makes the recordings available 24-48 hours after the lecture meets. Once videos are published, they are available for the duration of the semester.
