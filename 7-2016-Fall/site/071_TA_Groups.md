## TA Groups

This semester, all the students will be divided into a **TA Group** lead by one of the Teaching Assistants.

The purpose of this division is to facilitate smaller, more personal communities within a larger class.

Here are the details you should know about TA Groups:

+ Each week, your TA will hold open **Office Hours** during a 2 hour block, where the TA and group-mates can work together to answer questions, troubleshoot issues, etc.
+ Attending Office Hours is not required, and you can drop in/out at any point during the 2 hours.
+ At the start of the semester, we'll send out a **survey (<http://bit.ly/fall2016-ta-group-survey>)** to try and match you with a TA Group that holds Office Hours at a time that best works with your schedule<sup>1</sup>.
+ While we will make our best effort to find you a good match, it's not always possible as there's a lot of variance in each student's schedules, and only so many TAs. To help make things more flexible, students can &ldquo;float&rdquo; to different TA Group office hours *if needed*.
+ In most cases, your TA will also be in charge of grading your project, as they'll be most familiar with your work. However, sometimes we need to shuffle who grades what to make sure grading is evenly distributed amongst the TAs.

## How do I participate in my TA Group?

+ Each TA Group has its own Slack channel for inter-group communication.
+ Virtual groups:
    + At any point during the 2 hour Office Hours block, you can log in and interact with your TA and groupmates to ask questions and troubleshoot.
    + If there's need for it, a TA may initiate a Google Hangout to screenshare with the group.
+ Dan's in-person group:
    + Just like virtual groups, except you'll meet on campus, room 221 in Maxwell Dworkin.
    + You also have a Slack channel if you wish to communicate between meetings.


<hr>

<sup>1. When taking the survey, you'll note Office Hour times favor evening hours&mdash; we recognize that this may be inconvenient for students who work evenings or are in different timezones. Unfortunately, it's a matter of best utilizing resources for the greatest majority&mdash; past semester data indicates that only a small minority of students can attend afternoon hours, and it's typically not enough to warrant taking away an evening block that many more students can utilize. If none of the evening hours work for you, you can get assistance from the other less time-specific resources in the course such as Piazza and Slack.
