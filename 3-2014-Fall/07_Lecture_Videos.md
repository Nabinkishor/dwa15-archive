## Recorded Lecture

A recorded, on-demand version of the lecture will be posted by **Friday @ 5:30pm Eastern US time**.
(If there are technical issues which would delay this release, updated post times and details will be shared via Piazza.)

**You can find these videos via the [course publication listing](http://cm.dce.harvard.edu/2015/01/14291/publicationListing.shtml) ([mobile friendly version](http://cm.dce.harvard.edu/2015/01/14291/mobilePublicationListing.shtml)).**

Because we work a lot with detailed code in this course, *Large Video Window Display* is the suggested video preference:
