## Summary
Every student in this course will be assigned to a specific Workshop Section that meets once a week.
Each of these sections is lead by a TA, who will also be your grader for the course and your point-person should you need to talk about your project, issues related to the course, etc.

## What is covered?
These sections are open-ended and follow workshop format. This means there is no formal lecture or presentation; instead you can bring in your work to get assistance from your TA and peers.

Here are some examples of the kinds of things you may work on during a section:

+ Review lecture examples.
+ Ask a TA to clarify a topic you didn't understand in lecture.
+ Talk through ideas and plans for projects.
+ Get feedback on a project.
+ Get help debugging an issue related to your project (this is where the majority of section time will be spent).


## Which section do I belong to?
Here's how you find out what section you've been assigned to:
1. Login to [canvas.harvard.edu](https://canvas.harvard.edu).
2. From the top menu, click *Courses*.
3. On your list of courses, in addition to the regular course, you should see one with a time and TA name.

## Can I attend a section that I have not been assigned to?
To make sure all sections are balanced, no, you can not drop-in on other sections. The only exception to this is the time leading up to P1 as sections take a week or so to assign and you may need assistance before you have the opportunity to attend your assigned section.

## Is attendance required?
Nope. None of the sections in this course are required.
