Virtual workshop sections are held via web conferencing software called WebEx.

All you need to join a WebEx meeting is the link to that meeting, which will be posted on this page, by your TA, 20 minutes before a section begins.

The first time you join a WebEx meeting, you'll be prompted to download and install a browser plugin.

Recordings of sections (in case you miss one) will be posted on this page by Noon the day after the section meets.
