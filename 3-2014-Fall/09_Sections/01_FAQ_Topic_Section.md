## Summary
Each week, a TA will lead a lecture-style topic section that addresses frequently asked questions, or 
sheds light on topics that students want more coverage on. 

## When?
Tuesdays from 5:30-7:00pm EST.

## Where?
**In-person:** 1 Story Street, Rm 307 Cambridge, MA.

**Virtual:** Tune in via the [live classroom](http://cm.dce.harvard.edu/2015/01/14291/liveClassroom.shtml) or find the recording after the meeting on the [publication listing](http://cm.dce.harvard.edu/2015/01/14291/publicationListing.shtml).

## Who can attend?
Anyone! This section is open with no specific assignments.

## Is attendance required?
Nope. None of the sections in this course are required.

## What is covered?
Look in Piazza for a new thread after each lecture where you can make requests for topics you'd like to see covered. Because of time constraints, not all requests will be met, but we'll take your suggestions into consideration when planning. Mostly, our goal is to address common sticking points in the course material that would benefit from more coverage. Time permitting, we can touch on tangential topics.
