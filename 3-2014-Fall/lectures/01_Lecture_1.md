## Suggested strategy
1. Pre-lecture: Skim the notes.
2. Lecture: Take notes; don't try to code along with the lecture on your laptop. 
4. Post-lecture: Go through the notes again and complete any tasks which were covered.

* Document everything you do.
* Make notes about what you don't understand&mdash; go back and answer those questions as you move along.
