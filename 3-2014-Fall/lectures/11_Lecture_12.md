## Housekeeping

### Next week is Thanksgiving break:

+ No lecture on Thursday Nov 27 (Thanksgiving).
+ No sections Mon Nov 24 through Sun Nov 30 (Thanksgiving week). Sections will resume on Mon Dec 1.
+ The quiz for this week's lecture will have a longer window of availability because of the break&mdash; due Thu Dec 4 @ 5:30pm EST.




### P4 demos:
Typically, live demos happen *after* projects are due, but that's not possible at the end of the semester with P4. 

Given that, live demos will happen in the sections leading up to the end of the semester. Your TA will email you closer to the end of the semester with the specific date.

If you're not prepared to show your project by this date, you should go with the Jing demo option.

Any pre-recorded Jing demos are due when the project is due.
