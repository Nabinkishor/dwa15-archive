Today's our final class. Instead of a regular lecture, we'll have an open workshop to help you on P4 issues.

The workshop will last for the duration of our regular lecture time: **Thursday 5:30-7:30pm Eastern**.

**In-person students**: Bring your project questions - Myself and the TAs will be on hand to float around and help.

**Virtual students**: Sign up for a slot to work one on one with a TA via Skype: <http://virtual-workshop.dwa15.com>

Note: There will be no live stream or on-demand video from this session.

Final reminders:

+ P4 Due Thursday December 18th @ 5:30pm
+ Final date for submitting projects: December 20
+ Apply to be a TA: <http://ta-application.dwa15.com>
