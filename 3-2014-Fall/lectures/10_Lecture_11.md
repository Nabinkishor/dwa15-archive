There won’t be a live in-person lecture today (Thu Nov 13) for Lecture 11.

In place of the live lecture, I'm providing two pre-recorded lecture segments for the two topics we're focussing on this week: **Controllers** and **Validation**.

[(34:09) Watch the lecture on Controllers...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9H2NCNSPDM)

[(30:17) Watch the lecture on Validation...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JBV9jfqQSQ)

(These videos will also be available on the course publication listing as the lecture usually is on Fridays.)

What this means...

+ For remote students, no changes&mdash; you'll watch the lecture material online as you normally do.
+ For local students: instead of attending the live, in-person lecture, you should watch the material online.

<strike>The Foobooks example repository will be updated by the end of Thursday to reflect the changes made in the videos.</strike> <a href='https://github.com/susanBuck/foobooks'>It has been updated</a>.

If you have any questions while watching the material, don’t hesitate to post them to Piazza.

This change in format will not change the quiz timeline&mdash; it will be posted as usual on Monday @ 5:30pm EST.

Finally&mdash; last lecture I moved very quickly through Authentication and mentioned I would speak more about it this week&mdash; I'm pushing that recap to next week.

Enjoy the rest of your week!
Susan
