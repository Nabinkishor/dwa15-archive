## Submit projects

1. On the Canvas course homepage, you'll see a list of **Upcoming Assignments**. From this list, click the project you're submitting for ([screenshot](http://making-the-internet.s3.amazonaws.com/dwa-submit-project-1@2x.png)).

2. On the top right of the page, click the option to **Submit Assignment** ([screenshot](http://making-the-internet.s3.amazonaws.com/dwa-submit-project-2@2x.png)).

3. Enter your **project's GitHub URL** ([screenshot](http://making-the-internet.s3.amazonaws.com/dwa-submit-project-3@2x.png)). 
Note: Do *not* submit your site's URL, just the Github URL; we should be able to find the site URL in your `README.md` file.

4. Click **Submit Assignment** and you're all done.

## On making changes to your project after submitting...

We determine if a project is late by looking at when it was submitted *and* also by looking for any significant commits being made to your project after the due date. 

It's okay to make minor commits after a project has been submitted (fixing typos, spiffing up some CSS, adjusting some copy, etc.).

If we see significant commits coming in after the due date (adding features or other requirements, etc.) we will assume that project was not complete at the time of submission.

Occasionally a student may discover a bug after they submitted and they'll want to commit a fix for it. That's okay too, again, assuming it's not significant. Bug fixes will not be accepted after the TA has graded your project.


## View project feedback

1. Within the **Grades** section, if your project has received feedback you'll see a small comment icon next to the project.

2. Click the icon to reveal the feedback your TA left ([screenshot](http://making-the-internet.s3.amazonaws.com/dwa-view-feedback@2x.png)).

Feedback and grades for projects submitted by the deadline will be available in Canvas 7 days after the project deadline (unless otherwise announced).
