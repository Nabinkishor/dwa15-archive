## P3: Laravel Basics
The goal of this project is to give you hands-on practice with working with the essentials of building a Laravel-based site. In building this project you'll demonstrate an understanding of the following skills:

* Creating a new Laravel app.
* Installing and using Composer packages.
* Routing basics.
* Views.
* Deploying a Laravel app on a live server.




## Task
Create a web application called *Developer's Best Friend* which includes a **Lorem Ipsum Generator** and a **Random User Generator**. 

Your landing page should include a description of your app with either links to the two tools, or with the two tools present on the page.

The tools should be powered by HTML forms where the user can specify how many paragraphs they want, how many users they want, etc.

For your lorem ipsum text, you can use a Package such as [badcow/lorem-ipsum](https://packagist.org/packages/badcow/lorem-ipsum).

For your random users, you can use a Package such as [fzaninotto/faker](https://packagist.org/packages/fzaninotto/faker).

These packages are just suggestions; you're welcome to use others or write your own functionality.



## Examples
* <http://p3.dwa15.com>
* <http://lipsum.com>
* <http://cupcakeipsum.com>
* <http://randomuser.me>




## Extra Challenges
* Make it look nice.
* Give the option to include extra info for the generated users, such as birthdate, location, a small profile blurb, etc.
* Add your xkcd generator from p1 (not just a link&mdash; actually work the code into your Laravel app).
* Add a new feature: Permissions calculator (inspiration: <http://permissions-calculator.org/>)
* Include validation for any input.

## Misc
+ When completed, do not forget to add the link to your project and its Github repository to your P1 Portfolio. 
This should be done in addition to submitting your Github URL via Canvas.
