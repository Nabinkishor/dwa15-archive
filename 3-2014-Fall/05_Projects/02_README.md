It's common for software and code packages to include a `README.md` file in the root directory which contains basic information about the package such as author details, instructions for use, etc.

For projects hosted on Github, you can see the contents of the README file on the project's main Github page. For example, scroll down on <https://github.com/laravel/laravel> to see Laravel's README file.

It is required that each of your projects has its own `README.md` file in the root. Not only does this get you in the practice of writing the files, it will also provide necessary details for the teaching team when evaluating your project.

Here's the minimum content requirements for your `README.md`:

* Live URL of the project.
* Description of the project (2-3+ sentences).
* Demo information: If you attend your section to do an in-person demo, make a note of this. If you opt to do the Jing screencast demo, include the link here.
* Any details the instructor or TA needs to know, for example, test credentials.
* A list of any plugins, libraries, packages or outside code used in the project. See [Student Responsibilities](/Student_Responsibilities) for more details on avoiding code plagiarism.
	
## Format

`README.md` files are written using Markdown (hence the `.md` extension). Markdown is a simple syntax convention that lets you indicate things like headers, links, bullets, etc.

You can write your README file using Markdown by referring to this [Markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

If you view your markdown (`.md`) files in the browser, you'll see the raw markdown text. However, when you view these same files in Github, they'll render properly. 

To avoid having to repeatedly commit just to preview your work, you can compose your `README.md` file in a Markdown editor like <http://markdownlivepreview.com>. 

There are also many free, stand-alone markdown editors you can find via Google.
