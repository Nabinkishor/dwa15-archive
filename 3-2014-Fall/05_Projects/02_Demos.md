</div>

<br><br>


You are responsible for doing a short demo of Projects 2, 3 and 4, which counts toward your final point count for these projects.

You have the following delivery method options available for this demo:

## Option 1) Attend your section for a live demo.

For P2, P3 and P4 your TA will dedicate one section when students can present their projects in front of the TA and other students. This is a great opportunity to get peer feedback.

Your TA will contact you to let you know what section will be dedicated to demos (it may be after the project due date). If you are unable to attend the live demos, you have to use Option 2 below.

For virtual sections, the TA will share presenter privileges with you so you can walk through your project from your screen. Please make sure you prepare ahead for this by closing any irrelevant windows before the virtual section begins.

For in-person sections, you will demo your site using the computer in the lab. Because of this, it's essential that your site be available online.

If you are planning on doing a live demo, indicate so in your `README.md` file.



## Option 2) Include a short Jing screencast with your project 

If you are unable to attend the live demos during sections, you can record a walk-through of your project using Jing.

Jing is a free screencast program that's available for both Mac and PCs. You can download it here: <http://techsmith.com/download/jing/>.

Your screencast should include your screen in addition to your voice narration as you walk through your project.

After you record your video with Jing, it will give you the option to upload the video to their servers on Screencast.com. When the upload is complete you'll be given a URL to your video that looks something like this: `http://screencast.com/t/xad2f23842`. Include this link in your [README.md file](/Projects/README).

Jing has a max of 5 minutes for screencasts, which is perfect because your demo should not be longer than 5 minutes.

## Demo outline and example

Here's a rough outline of what the walk-through of your project should look like:

* What is the title of your application?
* What is the main purpose of goal of your application?
* Walk us through the application, describing and using the features as you go.

Time permitting...

* If there are technical aspects of your project you wish to highlight, you can briefly talk about how they were executed and even show relevant code snippets from your repository.
* Describe any challenges or issues you faced.
* Describe any features you'd like to see added to your project that you might not have been able to complete.
