## Base goals for each project
* Site is accessible online by the Instructor, the TAs and your peers.
* URL Follows the following conventions:
	+ `http://p1.yourdomain.com`
	+ `http://p2.yourdomain.com`
	+ `http://p3.yourdomain.com`
	+ `http://p4.yourdomain.com`
* `README.md` file is available and complete ([more details...](/Projects/README)).
* Attend your section to do an live demo of your project or provide a Jing screencast demo ([more details...](/Projects/Demos)).
* Github repository (unique to each project) with a healthy history of commits.
* Github repository is *public*; if you have an exception that requires a private repository, please notify your TA.
* Site [validates](http://validator.w3.org/) and uses proper/modern HTML/CSS structure. 
* Site has a clear heading (or logo), and makes it clear what the purpose of the site is and/or how to use it. Assume your site will be viewed by an audience outside of this class.
* Code is organized and neat.
* Good [DRY (Do Not Repeat Yourself)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself) code with clear [Separation of Concerns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) (both of these topics will be addressed in lecture).
* Interface and design is organized, readable and accessible.
* Site loads quickly (3 seconds or less is a reasonable goal).
* Submit on or before the deadline.
		
## Extra Challenges
* Each project has a *suggested* section titled *Extra Challenges* with ideas on how you can expand on your project. 
* Biting off some or all of these challenges is encouraged for more advanced students. 
* You're also welcome to come up with your own challenges.

## Languages
* You are welcome, but not required, to use __JavaScript__ in your projects (in addition to, not in place of PHP).
* You are welcome, but not required, to use __CSS pre-processors__ in your projects.
* You are highly encouraged to stick with __PHP__ as your server language, with __Laravel__ as your framework (where applicable). If you decide to go off-curriculum, you do so at your own risk. Furthermore, the useful feedback the teaching team will be able to give you may be limited. If you go off-curriculum with projects, you are still responsible for completing the PHP/Laravel related quizzes.
* Code, comments and README files must be written in English. If your site is intended for a non-English audience, you're welcome to display the copy in a language other than English, as long as Google Translate is able to translate it sufficiently enough for us to use the site when grading.

## Misc
+ See the [Grading](/Grading) page for details on late policies.
+ Make sure all work remains online, function, and in the same location where it was submitted for the duration of the semester.
