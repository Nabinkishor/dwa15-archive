## Housekeeping

This is our last &ldquo;official&rdquo; lecture.

**Next week**, for Week/Lecture 14 we'll be doing a __project workshop__ where the entire teaching team will be on deck helping answer your individual project questions.

The project workshop will take place during our regular lecture time (Wed Dec 9 5:30-7:30pm Eastern).

__For in person students:__ You're welcome to come to the lecture hall as usual; myself and some other TAs will be on hand to bounce around and help you with project related questions. You can also use this time to help out/get help from a classmate.

__For remote students:__ To coordinate us helping you, we'll use this sign-up spreadsheet Wednesday  evening: <http://bit.ly/dwa-workshop>

FYI: Because there won't be an official lecture, there will be no Lecture 14 live stream or video posted.
