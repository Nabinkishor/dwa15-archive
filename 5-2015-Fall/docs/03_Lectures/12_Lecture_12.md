## Lecture

Why the book/author queries we were testing at the end of last lecture didn't work - Order of operations issue.

With that fixed, we can finish the discussion of [querying with relationships](https://github.com/susanBuck/dwa15-fall2015-notes/blob/master/03_Laravel/22_Relationships_One_to_Many.md#querying-with-relationships).

Revisit *Edit Book* feature now that the approach to authors has changed.

[Many to Many](https://github.com/susanBuck/dwa15-fall2015-notes/blob/master/03_Laravel/23_Relations_Many_to_Many.md) and Tags cont'd

Authentication:

+ [Building Authentication](https://github.com/susanBuck/dwa15-fall2015-notes/blob/master/03_Laravel/24_Building_Authentication.md)
+ [Using Authentication](https://github.com/susanBuck/dwa15-fall2015-notes/blob/master/03_Laravel/25_Using_Authentication.md)



## To-do

[ ] Progress on foobooks practice

+ Switch to a dropdown for authors on the *Edit Book* page
+ Get registering and logging in/out working
+ Lock down some routes using authentication
+ Vary how something is displayed based on authentication (like how we did with the nav menu)
+ Things not specifically covered in lecture but which you have the know-how to do and might want to practice with:
    + Update how authors are associated with books on the Add Book page
    + Create a add/edit functionality for Authors
    + Create a add/edit functionality for Tags

[ ] Progress on P4

[ ] Take Quiz 12, available Mon Nov 23 @ 5:30pm Eastern
