## The basics
+ Sections will begin meeting Sunday Sep 13th.
+ Sections in this course are optional.
+ Some sections are in-person, and some are virtual.
+ Virtual sections operate via Slack and web-conferencing software, WebEx (more info below).
+ All sections are 2 hours long and meet once a week.
+ If you opt out of attending sections, you will still be assigned to a specific TA as your &ldquo;point person&rdquo; for the course, and for grading purposes.




## What happens in sections?
Sections in this course are very relaxed; most of the section time will operate as &ldquo;open office hours&rdquo; with your TA and section-mates, where you can bring in specific questions and get troubleshooting help.

Sometimes, though, a TA may decide to dedicate a portion of the section to a mini-lecture where they cover material to enforce or supplement lecture material.

How section time is spent is up to the discretion of your TA, as they will adjust depending on the needs of the students.

## What section am I in?
To find out what section you were assigned to, log into Canvas, go to the __People__ section and search for your name ([screenshot](http://dwa15.com.s3.amazonaws.com/seeing-section-assignments-in-canvas.png)).

A survey was sent out at the beginning of the semester to get student preferences for section meeting times; all efforts were made to cater to your top choices when possible, but some balancing had to be done.

If you did not take the survey, or have some issue with your final section assignment, don't panic. Email me and we'll sort it out.




## Can I attend a section I was not assigned to?
Generally it's best if you stick to the section you're assigned to so we can make sure attendance is balanced across all sections.

However, we understand some weeks your schedule might make it difficult to attend your assigned section.

If this happens and you want to &ldquo;sit in&rdquo; on another TA's section, that's fine, just drop them an email to double check first. If TAs are at capacity with their students, they may deny your request, but in most cases they should be able to accommodate you.




## How can I communicate with my section-mates?
Every section has a private group in Slack.

Once you're in your section's private group, you'll see it listed on the left.
For example, if you're in Alain's section, you'd see this: [screenshot](http://dwa15.com.s3.amazonaws.com/section-private-group-example.png).

I've done my best to invite every student to their section's private group, but may not have got you if you're not in Slack yet, or in Slack under a name that differs from your name in the roster.

If you don't see your section's private group, email your TA ([contact info](http://dwa15.com/TAs)) and they can invite you.






## I'm in a virtual section, how do I participate?
When your section time is about to start, your TA will communicate with you via your Slack section private group. One of the primary things they will do is share a URL you can use to join a __WebEx web conference__.

The WebEx conference will allow the group of you to talk and share your screens in real-time during the two hours in which your section meets.

Outside of your designated section meeting times, you may also communicate with your section-mates and TA in the section private group.

The first few times you use WebEx (if it's new to you), you may have to take some time to get familiar with the software. You may have to download some plugins, troubleshoot why your audio isn't working, etc. We've found this is par for the course for most web conference software, and in our various tests, WebEx has the *fewest*   kinks. That being said, it's not without kinks, so be patient, and don't be afraid to ask your TA for help.




## I'm in an in-person section, how do I attend?
Both the in-person sections meet in Northwest B108 ([here's a map](http://dwa15.com.s3.amazonaws.com/northwest-map.png)).

In-person sections also have private section groups in Slack you can use to communicate with your TA and section-mates outside of designated section meeting times.




## I couldn't attend my virtual section. Is there a recording?
Virtual sections held in WebEx are recorded. After a section meets, when the recording is available, your TA will post the URL in your Slack section private group.

Because of resource limitations, only recordings for the most 2-3 recent sections will be available. Older sections will be deleted on a rolling basis as we progress through the semester.




## I couldn't attend my in-person section. Is there a recording?
In-person sections are not recorded. If you're interested in watching one of the virtual sections for a given week, email a TA that leads a virtual section and ask them for the recording URL.
