In this course, we use a developer-focused chat system called __Slack__.

Our class slack lives at <http://dwa15.slack.com>.

To join the class Slack, you will first need to be invited. If you didn't receive an email before class with the invite, email susanbuck@fas.harvard.edu to request an invite.

You can use Slack via their web interface but we suggest downloading a stand-alone app for an optimized experience: <https://slack.com/apps>.

Now that you're set up with Slack, let's take a tour...

## Channels
Our class Slack has two channels, which are public to all students.


### #lecture
The `#lecture` channel is used for students who have questions during lecture. Our TAs monitor this room during the live lecture, so if you're a virtual student you can pose questions here. If the TA feels it's a question the whole class will benefit from, they will raise their hand during lecture and ask it on your behalf.

You can also ask for clarifications during lecture. For example, if I announce a URL during lecture and you don't quite catch it&mdash; you can ask in the #lecture channel and a TA or peer can help clarify.

Try to keep this channel &ldquo;quiet&rdquo; and only use it for questions. Many students try to simultaneously keep up with the lecture while using this room, so too much chatter can be distracting.

If you do wish to engage in more general chatter, see the next channel...

### #general
The `#general` channel is also open to all students, and is available for general chatter. Feel free to use this room during and outside of the live lecture.

## Private Groups

Private groups are used for section discussion where you communicate with your section-mates and TA. The private groups are named according to the TA's name (`pats_section`, `katys_section`, etc.). Once sections are sorted out at the start of the semester, you'll be invited by your TA to join the appropriate section group.

## A note on troubleshooting in Slack

Slack is great for communicating with your classmates and TAs in a real-time fashion. For our virtual students, it's especially useful because it creates a sense of community.

That being said, Slack is not a substitute for posting troubleshooting questions in Piazza.

Because there may be a lot of traffic on Slack at times, it's possible troubleshooting queries might get lost in the flow, and we won't know if your issue has been resolved or not.


## Tip: Sharing code

In *Preferences*, under *Advanced Options*, check off the option that says __When typing code with ```, ENTER should not send the message.__.

Now, when you're sharing code snippets in the chat, you can begin and end the snippet with three backticks:

Doing this will make your code display in a readable, mono-spaced font:
