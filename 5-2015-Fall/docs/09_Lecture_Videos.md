Lecture videos for this course are available via the following two formats during the __Fall 2015__ semester:

## 1. Live Lectures
Lectures are streamed live on __Wednesday's 5:30-7:30pm Eastern Time__.

To watch the live stream, log into Canvas (<http://canvas.harvard.edu>) and find this class, *CSCI E-15*.

Then, from the menu on the left, find the __Virtual Classroom__ section.

During the live stream, you'll see a link to watch the lecture above the list of recorded lectures.

Remote students are welcome to use our Slack chat to "participate" during the live lectures. Read the page on [Slack](Slack_Chat) for more details.

## 2. Recorded Lectures
If you miss the live stream, you can log into the Virtual Classroom (described above) and see a list of recorded lectures.

Note that recorded lectures take 24-48 hours after the lecture meets to become available online. Once videos are published, they are available for the duration of the semester.

Regarding playing videos on mobile devices: I'm told this feature is on the to-do list for the HES video production team, but will not be supported for the Fall term.
