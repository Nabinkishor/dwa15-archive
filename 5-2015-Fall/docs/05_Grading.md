## Participation

Working in web development is rarely a solitary job. In real world work environments you will find yourself interacting with teams, clients, and peers where you will have to learn to effectively communicate technical problems and ideas.

Even if you work independently, you will find yourself using industry resources like StackOverflow where strong communication skills are essential.

To practice your technical communication skills, one of your responsibilities in this course is to be an active member on Piazza, helping your peers troubleshoot their problems and providing constructive feedback when applicable.

Not only will this practice sharpen your technical communication skills, you'll be amazed by how much you learn when you help others.

Participation is evaluated at the end of the semester on a scale of 0-10 points.

Points are determined by your TA and the instructor, with consideration given to your values in the *Statistics* tab in Piazza.

* 7-10 Points: You went above and beyond helping other students and were among the top contributors on Piazza.
* 5-7 Points: You were consistently helpful throughout the semester.
* 2-5 Points: You were occasionally helpful, but some weeks you didn't participate at all.
* 0-2: You rarely helped.




## Quizzes

Individual quizzes are each worth 100 points and consist of 10 questions (10 points each).

At the end of the semester, your quiz average will make up 40 points (i.e. 40%) of your final grade.

### Project late penalties

+ Up to 1 week past due: 20% off total possible points
+ Up to 2 weeks past due: 30% off total possible points
+ Up to 3 weeks past due: 40% off total possible points
+ Up to 4 weeks past due: 100% off total possible points

If your submission is late, make sure you notify your TA so they're aware your project is ready for grading/feedback.

It is not the TA's responsibility to track down missing work or troubleshoot broken projects. Make sure you submit your work as instructed and that everything has been tested before submission.

### One Free Late Pass
Each student has one **late pass** for the semester which will reduce your late deduction by 20%.

<img src='http://dwa15.com.s3.amazonaws.com/one-free-late-pass@2x.png' style='width:400px'>

If you need to use your late pass, you do not need to specify which project you wish to use it on&mdash; we will automatically calculate it for you at the end of the semester, applying it where it would be most beneficial to you.

Example scenarios:

+ You turn all your projects on time, except P1 is 3 days late. P1 should face a 20% deduction but your late pass is used to bring the deduction down to 0%.

+ You turn all your projects on time, except P1 is 13 days late. P1 should face a 40% deduction but your late pass is used to bring the deduction down to 20%.

+ You turn in P1 and P2 on time, but you turn P3 in 5 days late, and P4 in 5 days late. Your late pass is used on P4 (since it has a higher point weight) bringing its deduction down to 0%.

The late pass is provided to account for personal circumstances (computer crashes, health, job, religious holidays, family, etc.). Because of this, there will be **no late exceptions beyond this pass**.

This goal of this policy is to keep things fair amongst all students and prevents myself or the TAs from having to make time-consuming judgement calls on what individual circumstances merit exceptions.
