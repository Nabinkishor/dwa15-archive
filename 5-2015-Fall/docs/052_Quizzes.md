## Quizzes

Each week there will be an online quiz proctored through Canvas (<http://canvas.harvard.edu>).

Quizzes are **available on 5:30pm on Mondays** after the Wednesday lecture meets.

Quizzes are **due by 5:30pm on Wednesdays**, i.e. right before the next lecture meets.

Example:

Each quiz contains **10 multiple choice questions** which will pull from the lecture material **and** assigned readings.

You will have **20 minutes** to complete each quiz (past data indicates this should be plenty of time).

When taking the quiz, you will be shown **one question at a time and you can not go back to review past questions**.

Given the above two points, it's essential that you do the following before attempting the quiz:

+ Watch/attend the lecture.
+ Complete any assigned tasks from the end of lecture.
+ Do any assigned readings.

An example quiz (not counted) will be given after Lecture 1 to give you a feel for the kind of questions to expect and how much you'll need to prepare for each quiz.

In addition to dropping the first quiz, your 2 lowest quiz scores will be dropped.

Late quizzes are not accepted, **with no exceptions**. The padding of dropping the 2 lowest quiz scores is provided to account for personal circumstances (computer crashes, health, job, religious holidays, vacation, family, etc.).

Quizzes must be taken independently; you may not complete quizzes during sections. Taking a quiz while attending a section will result in a 0 for that quiz.


## FAQ

### Q: Can the quizzes be released earlier? I'd like to work on them over the weekend.

A: Because quizzes are customized to each semester's lecture, the teaching team needs time to author quizzes and exchange feedback about the questions before quizzes are published. Given this, we will not release quizzes earlier than the time stated above.

### Q: How come there's a time limit and why can't I go back to review my answers?

With an open-book quiz it can be tempting to not prepare ahead of time, and attempt to look up the answers as you go. The idea of the quizzes, however, is to assess engagement in the material in the previous class&mdash; this includes the lecture itself, the readings, and any homework tasks. Given this, by the time a student sits down to take the quiz they should be prepared to answer the questions with only minimal reference.
