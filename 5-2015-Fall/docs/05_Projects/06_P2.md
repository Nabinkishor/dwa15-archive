## P2: PHP Basics
The goal of this project is to give you hands-on practice with working with the basics of PHP.

## Task
Create an [xkcd style password](http://xkcd.com/936/) generator.

## Inspiration/Examples
* **[p2.dwa15.com](http://p2.dwa15.com)**
* [correcthorsebatterystaple.net](http://correcthorsebatterystaple.net/)
* [preshing on programming](http://preshing.com/20110811/xkcd-password-generator/)
* [secure, memorable password generator](https://www.xkpasswd.net/c/index.cgi)
* [Joel's Password Generator](http://jpgen.joelwalters.com/)


## Goals
* Landing page includes a description of your app and what a xkcd password is (assume an unfamiliar audience).
* Form inputs to specify:
	* How many words to use.
	* Whether to include a number.
	* Whether to include a special symbol (for example, `@`).

## Extra Challenges
* Add more configurations:
	* How many special characters.
	* Spaces or [camelCase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase) or hyphens.
	* Max length.
	* All upper case, or all lower case, or make the first letter of each word upper case.
	* Etc...
* Error checking: For example, what happens if a user enters a string instead of an integer for # of words?
* Scrape an online word list to build a really long word list. (No clue where to start? [Here's an outline](https://gist.github.com/susanBuck/a81365a69d3a8649db0b) for approach).


## Misc
+ When completed, do not forget to add the link to your project and its Github repository to your P1 Portfolio.
This should be done in addition to submitting your Github URL via Canvas.
