You are responsible for doing a short demo of Projects 2, 3 and 4, which counts toward your final point count for these projects.

Demos are created using Jing, a free screencast program that's available for both Mac and PCs.

You can download it here: <http://techsmith.com/download/jing/>.

Your screencast should include your screen in addition to your voice narration as you walk through your project.

After you record your video, Jing will give you the option to upload the video to their servers on Screencast.com. When the upload is complete you'll be given a URL to your video that looks something like this: `http://screencast.com/t/xad2f23842`.

Include this link in your [README.md file](/Projects/README).

Jing has a max of **5 minutes** for screencasts, which is perfect because your demo should not be longer than 5 minutes.

It's suggested you download and do a quick test with Jing early in the semester. That way you won't run into technical difficulties close to project deadlines.




## Demo outline and example

Here's a rough outline of what the walk-through of your project should look like:

* What is the title of your application?
* What is the main purpose of goal of your application?
* Walk us through the application, describing and using the features as you go.

Time permitting...

* If there are technical aspects of your project you wish to highlight, you can briefly talk about how they were executed and even show relevant code snippets from your repository.
* Describe any challenges or issues you faced.
* Describe any features you'd like to see added to your project that you might not have been able to complete.
