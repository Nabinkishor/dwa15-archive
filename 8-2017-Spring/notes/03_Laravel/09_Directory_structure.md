## Directory structure

Most frequently used files/directories:

| Path  | Usage |
|---|---|
| `/routes/web.php`  | Where all your web **routes** go; think of this as the map of your application.  |
| `/app`  | Where all your **models** go  |
| `/resources/views/` | Where all your **views** go |
| `/app/Http/Controllers` | Where all your **controllers** go |
| `/config/` | Where all your configurations are set |
| `/.env` | Where configurations that are specific to the *current* environment are set |
| `/composer.json` | Composer config file - Where you manage what dependencies your application has |

## Tip
Some code editors have a &ldquo;fuzzy finder&rdquo; feature that lets you search for files across a loaded directory.

For example, in Atom, you can use the keyboard shortcut `command` + `p` to quickly locate and open files from directories loaded in your tree view.
