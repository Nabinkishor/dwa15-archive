# Style

It's common for development teams to have a coding style guide&mdash; a set of rules for how code should be written, which covers details like:

+ Case conventions - e.g., when/where to use lowerCamelCase, snake_case, UpperCamelCase, etc.
+ Structural conventions - e.g., whether to use spaces or tabs, what's the maximum length a line of code should be, etc.
+ Etc...

The purpose of a style guide is to keep work consistent amongst a group of developers.
Even if you're working independently, abiding by a style guide will help produce more consistent code that's less prone to errors.

As an example, this is the [Ruby style guide that the team at Github.com uses](https://github.com/github/rubocop-github/blob/master/STYLEGUIDE.md).

On a more macro level, sometimes entire languages have dedicated style guides, such as the case with [Python's PEP 8 style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

PHP has two style guides maintained by the [PHP Framework Interop Group (FIG)](http://www.php-fig.org):

+ [PSR-1 Basic Coding Standard](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1)
+ [PSR-2 Coding Style Guide](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/)

When a language has an official style guide, it's not required that it be implemented 100%, and teams may decide to go off course with their own variations.

For this course, we have our own style guide that outlines some conventions you must follow in your assignments.

This guide is not comprehensive&mdash; for any topic not addressed, you can defer to the FIG PHP style guides referenced above.

If you have strong opinions about style that contradict what you see in this guide, you can go off-course but you must fork your own version of the course style guide, outlining the rules your code will abide by.

The emphasis is not about what style guide you're following, simply that you are following *some* style guide and are aiming to be consistent and thoughtful in regards to code design.

If you do fork your own style guide, save it as `styleguide.md` in the root of the given assignment and make a note in your assignment submission.
