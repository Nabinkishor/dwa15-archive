# Avoiding Code Plagiarism
The internet is full of tutorials and examples for the kind of application you'll create for this assignment. Aside from the serious academic consequences, to build your assignment based on any found examples would only be cheating yourself from the experience of completing the work.

This is not to say you can't use outside resources as guidance&mdash; the ability to troubleshoot and seek out answers is one of the learning goals of this course.

Just think carefully about the kind of help you're looking for in your searches.

For example:
+ Safe search: *how do I round a number up in php*
+ Dangerous search: *php tip calculator*

The first example is very specific to one component of your application, while the latter example is too broad.

Also be smart about looking at classmate's code. Again, one of the goals of this course is to collaborate with others and because of that, we use public repositories and freely share code for troubleshooting purposes. That being said, there is an obvious line between looking at a classmates code to help them troubleshoot their specific problem, and looking at a classmates code because you can't figure out something in your own assignment. The former is encouraged, while the latter is unacceptable. If you are stuck, you should narrow down your question and articulate it in Piazza.

Red flags that may cause us to have concern about the originality of your work:
+ Program is designed in a way that is noticibly different than the approaches used in lecture.
+ Work submitted is of a noticibly different quality than other code we've seen from you (in Piazza, office hours, etc.)
+ Work shows high similarity to other code using [Standford's Measure Of Software Similarity program](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/)

Assignments that raise concerns of originality may be submitted to the HES academic board for review.

If you have any concerns or questions about code originality, discuss with me or your TA.
