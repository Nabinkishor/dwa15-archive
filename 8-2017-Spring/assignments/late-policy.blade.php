# Assignment late policy
All assignments should be turned in on time.

If you are unable to submit your assignment by its Thursday 11:59pm deadline, you may extend the deadline to the following Monday by 11:59pm with a 5% reduction of the total possible points of that assignment.

For each day late after the Monday extension, an additional 5% reduction will apply.

Assignments will not be accepted beyond 7 days late as it's crucial you turn assignments in on time to keep up with new material.

<small>
Please do not ask the teaching team to weigh in on whether you would earn a higher grade if you submitted incomplete work on-time vs. submitting complete work late. To accurately assess this would require us to fully evaluate your project ahead of time, which would be unfair to other students; it is up to you to weigh the costs.

### One Free Late Pass

<img src='http://dwa15.com.s3.amazonaws.com/one-free-late-pass@2x.png' style='max-width:300px;' alt=''>

When submitting an assignment late, you can choose to apply a late pass, which will give you the extension to Monday *without* the 5% reduction. I.e. you can submit the assignment late with no penalty.

You can only do this *once* during the semester, and you must opt to use your pass at the time of submission (there will be a checkbox on the submission form where you can indicate that you wish to use your late pass).

The late pass is provided to account for personal circumstances (computer crashes, health, job, religious holidays, family, etc.). Because of this, there will be no late exceptions beyond this pass.
