**A note on the class requirement in Assignment 2:**

A requirement of A2 states: *You should use at least 1 Class/Object.*
To satisfy this requirement you can do one of the following:

1. Utilize the provided [*Form*](https://github.com/susanBuck/dwa15-php-practice/blob/master/Form.php) class
2. Write your own class to meet your assignment needs (like [*Library*](https://github.com/susanBuck/dwa15-php-practice/blob/master/foobooks/Library.php) in [Foobooks](https://github.com/susanBuck/dwa15-php-practice/blob/master/foobooks))
3. Do both 1 & 2


## To-do
+ [Complete A1 Quiz in Canvas (if you haven't already) before Thu Feb 16 @ 11:59pm Eastern](https://piazza.com/class/ixuqcux7ltt49d?cid=52)
+ Complete [A2](/assignments/a2) and [submit](/submit/?aid=2) before Thu Feb 23 11:59pm Eastern).
+ Take Lecture 4 quiz in Canvas before the start of next lecture (Thu Feb 23 6:30pm Eastern).
